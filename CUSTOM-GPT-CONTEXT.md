In the field of advanced NLP, various topologies, including chains, trees, and graphs, play a crucial role in structuring LLM reasoning:

1. **Chains**: These introduce intermediate thoughts between input and output, enhancing clarity and traceability. They are cost-effective, requiring fewer resources.

2. **Trees**: Trees enable the exploration of multiple next-step variants, facilitating broader solution exploration. They excel in quality and complexity, making them superior for high-quality outcomes.

3. **Graphs**: Graphs represent the most complex structure, allowing diverse connections and interactions for multifaceted problem-solving. They are flexible and handle complex tasks where linear reasoning falls short.

Prompt engineering is essential for LLMs, optimizing queries for complex tasks. Different prompting schemes can be modeled as graph topologies, reflecting the structure of reasoning. The taxonomy helps categorize designs based on topology representation and reasoning schedule.

Analysis of prompting methods considers accuracy, latency, and cost-effectiveness, highlighting trade-offs. Opportunities include exploring new topology classes, automating topology derivation, enhancing single-prompt schemes, and investigating new scheduling approaches.

Integrating structure-enhanced prompting with graph neural networks and complex system architectures is promising. Hardware acceleration, diversifying modalities, and improving retrieval mechanisms offer areas for improvement.

Several works explore integrating knowledge graphs and graph-related generative AI with LLMs. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of prompting schemes and their potential to enhance LLM capabilities in various domains.

# MISSIONYou are a Sparse Priming Representation (SPR) decompressor. An SPR is a particular kind of use of language for advanced NLP, NLU, and NLG tasks, particularly useful for the latest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs). You will be given an SPR and your job is to fully unpack it.# THEORYLLMs are a kind of deep neural network. They have been demonstrated to embed knowledge, abilities, and concepts, ranging from reasoning to planning, and even to theory of mind. These are called latent abilities and latent content, collectively referred to as latent space. The latent space of an LLM can be activated with the correct series of words as inputs, which will create a useful internal state of the neural network. This is not unlike how the right shorthand cues can prime a human mind to think in a certain way. Like human minds, LLMs are associative, meaning you only need to use the correct associations to "prime" another model to think in the same way.# METHODOLOGYUse the primings given to you to fully unpack and articulate the concept. Talk through every aspect, impute what's missing, and use your ability to perform inference and reasoning to fully elucidate this concept. Your output should be in the form of the original article, document, or material.

# Codebase Context Specification

Specification Version: 1.0-RFC
Date: 2024-08-31

## 1. Overview

Codebase Context is a convention similar to .env and .editorconfig systems, but focused on documenting your code for both AI and humans. Just as .env files manage environment variables and .editorconfig ensures consistent coding styles, CCS files provide a standardized way to capture and communicate the context of your codebase.

This convention allows developers to:

1. Document high-level architecture and design decisions
2. Explain project-specific conventions and patterns
3. Highlight important relationships between different parts of the codebase
4. Provide context that might not be immediately apparent from the code itself
5. By adopting this convention, teams can ensure that both human developers and AI assistants have access to crucial contextual information, leading to better code understanding, more accurate suggestions, and improved overall development efficiency.

## 2. Key Principles

1. **Flexibility**: Support multiple file formats and context types.
2. **Proximity**: Keep context close to the code it describes.
3. **Hierarchy**: Allow for project-wide, directory-level, and file-specific context.
4. **Clarity**: Promote clear, maintainable context files.
5. **AI-Centric**: Optimize for AI model consumption and interpretation.

## 3. File Structure

### 3.1 File Names

Context files must use one of the following extensions:

<div align="center">

[.context.md](#markdown-format-default "Markdown format (default, supports both structured and unstructured content)") | [.context.yaml](#yaml-format "YAML format") or [.context.yml](#yaml-format "YAML format") | [.context.json](#json-format "JSON format")

</div>

The .context.md extension is the default and recommended format as it supports both structured (via YAML front matter) and unstructured content.

### 3.2 File Locations

Context files can be placed at multiple levels within a project:

- Project root: For project-wide context (highly recommended)
- Directories: For context specific to that directory and its contents

Example structure:

project_root/
├── .context.md
├── .contextignore
├── .contextdocs.md
├── src/
│   ├── .context.yaml
│   ├── module1/
│   │   └── .context.md
│   └── module2/
│       └── .context.json
└── tests/
    └── .context.md


## 4. File Formats

### 4.1 Markdown Format (Default)

Markdown files (.context.md) are the default and recommended format. They can include an optional YAML front matter for structured data, followed by free-form Markdown content. The structured data should now include role-specific sections.

# Codebase Context Specification

This document provides comprehensive context for the Codebase Context Specification project, which defines a standardized way to provide explicit context information about a codebase, enabling more effective AI-assisted development.

## Architecture Overview

The Codebase Context Specification follows a documentation-driven architecture, consisting of the following main components:

1. Specification Document: The core definition of the Codebase Context format and usage.
2. Context Editor: A tool for creating and editing .context.md files.
3. TypeScript Linter: A linter implementation to validate .context.md files against the specification.

The data flow in this system is as follows:
Codebase -> .context.md files -> Linter -> Validation results

This architecture ensures that the specification is well-defined, easy to implement, and can be validated automatically.

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the conventions listed in the front matter, including Markdown best practices and consistent naming conventions.
- Use YAML for structured data within the .context.md files.
- When contributing to the TypeScript linter, use lowercase and underscores for all .ts files.
- Write clear, concise documentation for all components of the specification.
- Use feature branches and pull requests for all changes to the specification or related tools.

## Business Context

The primary goal of the Codebase Context Specification is to provide developers and AI assistants with a standardized format for capturing and communicating codebase context. Key features include:

- A flexible, hierarchical structure for context information
- Support for multiple file formats (Markdown, YAML, JSON)
- Integration with existing development workflows

Success will be measured by the adoption rate among developers and the improvement in AI-assisted development accuracy when using the Codebase Context Specification.

## Quality Assurance

Our QA process ensures high-quality, reliable tools and documentation through:

- Comprehensive unit and integration testing using Jest and Pytest
- Maintaining a test coverage threshold of 90%
- Performance benchmarking for linting speed and memory usage
- Regular review and updates to the specification based on community feedback

## Deployment and Operations

The Codebase Context Specification project is managed and deployed as follows:

1. The specification and related tools are hosted on GitHub
2. GitHub Actions are used for continuous integration and deployment
3. Documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages (staging environment)
4. The TypeScript linter is published as an npm package (production environment)

Regular updates and maintenance are performed to keep the specification and tools up-to-date with evolving development practices and AI capabilities.


### 4.2 YAML Format

YAML format (.context.yaml or .context.yml) should now include the expanded role-specific sections and use kebab-case for key names.

Example:

yaml
module-name: Codebase Context Specification
version: 1.0.0

  staging-environment: GitHub Pages (Documentation)
  production-environment: npm registry (Linter package)


### 4.3 JSON Format

JSON format (.context.json) should also include the expanded role-specific sections. Note that JSON doesn't support kebab-case for key names, so we'll use camelCase as it's a common convention in JSON.

Example:

json
{
  "moduleName": "Codebase Context Specification",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A specification for providing explicit context information about a codebase",
  "relatedModules": [
    {

    },
    {
      "name": "TypeScript Linter",

    "platform": "GitHub",
    "cicdPipeline": "GitHub Actions",
    "stagingEnvironment": "GitHub Pages (Documentation)",
    "productionEnvironment": "npm registry (Linter package)"
  }
}


## 5. Context Accumulation and Usage

1. Context accumulates as you traverse deeper into the directory structure.
2. More specific contexts provide additional detail to broader contexts.
3. AI models should consider all relevant context files, prioritizing more specific contexts when appropriate.
4. There is no strict overriding; AI judges context relevance based on the query or task.
5. .context.md files can be placed anywhere in the codebase, but having one at the root that references others is highly recommended.
6. The root .context.md file should provide an overview of the project and reference other important context files throughout the codebase.

## 6. The .contextignore File

The .contextignore file, placed in the project root, excludes files or directories from context consideration.

### Syntax

- Uses glob patterns similar to .gitignore
- Lines starting with # are comments

Example:
# Ignore all .log files
*.log

# Ignore the entire build directory
build/

# Ignore all .test.js files
**/*.test.js

# Ignore a specific file
src/deprecated-module.js

# Ignore all files in any directory named 'temp'
**/temp/*


**Warning:** Tooling may be required for proper implementation of .contextignore. AI agents may not consistently or easily use .contextignore as strictly as dedicated tooling can. Your mileage may vary (YMMV) depending on the AI model used.

## 7. The .contextdocs File

The .contextdocs file allows developers to specify external documentation sources that should be incorporated into the project's context. This feature is particularly useful for including documentation from dependencies, libraries, or related projects.

### 7.1 Location and Naming

- The .contextdocs file should be placed in the root directory of the project.
- It must use one of the following extensions:
  - .contextdocs.md (default, recommended)
  - .contextdocs.yaml or .contextdocs.yml
  - .contextdocs.json

### 7.2 File Structure

The .contextdocs file should contain an array of documentation sources. Each source can be:

- A file path relative to the project root
- A URL to a markdown file
- A package name with associated documentation files

### 7.3 Examples

#### Markdown Format (.contextdocs.md) - Default

  ]
}


### 7.4 Behavior

- When an AI model or related tool is processing the project context, it should fetch and incorporate the specified documentation.
- For local files, the content should be read from the specified path.
- For URLs, the content should be fetched from the provided URL.
- For packages, the documentation should be fetched from the package's repository or documentation site, based on the package name and version.

**Warning:** Tooling may be required for proper implementation of .contextdocs. AI agents may not consistently or easily use .contextdocs as strictly as dedicated tooling can. Your mileage may vary (YMMV) depending on the AI model used.

### 7.5 Use Cases

- Including documentation for key dependencies
- Referencing company-wide coding standards or guidelines
- Incorporating design documents or architectural overviews
- Linking to relevant external resources or tutorials

### 7.6 Considerations

- Ensure that URLs point to stable, version-controlled documentation to maintain consistency.
- Be mindful of the total volume of documentation to avoid overwhelming the AI model with irrelevant information.
- Regularly review and update the .contextdocs file to ensure all referenced documentation remains relevant and up-to-date.
- Consider implementing caching mechanisms for external documentation to improve performance and reduce network requests.

## 8. Conclusion

The Codebase Context Specification provides a flexible, standardized approach to enriching codebases with contextual information for AI models. By adopting this convention and including role-specific information, development teams can enhance AI-assisted workflows, improving code quality and development efficiency across projects of any scale or complexity. The addition of role-specific guidelines and consistent naming conventions ensures that AI models have access to comprehensive, relevant, and well-structured information tailored to different aspects of the software development lifecycle.

Codebase Context Specification
Specification Version: 1.0-RFC
Date: 2024-08-31

1. Overview
The Codebase Context Specification (CCS) is a convention designed to document your codebase for both AI and human consumption, akin to systems like .env for environment variables and .editorconfig for coding styles. CCS helps teams capture and communicate essential context, architecture, and design decisions, making the codebase more accessible to developers and AI systems.

This approach improves understanding, accuracy of code suggestions, and overall development efficiency by ensuring that critical context information is explicitly available.

Key Use Cases:
Documenting high-level architecture and design choices
Explaining project-specific conventions and patterns
Highlighting relationships across the codebase
Providing essential context that might not be obvious from the code itself
By adopting this standard, both developers and AI systems can interpret and leverage the context to provide better, more accurate insights and suggestions.

2. Key Principles
Flexibility: Supports various file formats (Markdown, YAML, JSON) and context types.
Proximity: Keeps context close to the relevant code or directory.
Hierarchy: Allows project-wide, directory-level, and file-specific context.
Clarity: Encourages clear, maintainable, and well-structured context files.
AI-Centric: Optimized for AI models to easily interpret and process.
3. File Structure
3.1 File Names
CCS uses specific extensions for context files. Accepted formats include:

.context.md (default, recommended)
.context.yaml or .context.yml
.context.json
Markdown is preferred due to its support for both structured (via YAML front matter) and unstructured content.

3.2 File Locations
CCS files can be placed at different levels within a project hierarchy:

Project Root: For overall project context.
Directory Level: For directory-specific context.
File Level: For detailed context relevant to a specific file or module.
Example project structure:

bash
Copy code
project_root/
├── .context.md            # Project-wide context
├── .contextignore         # Exclude files or directories from context consideration
├── .contextdocs.md        # External documentation sources
├── src/
│   ├── .context.yaml      # Context for the src directory
│   ├── module1/
│   │   └── .context.md    # Context specific to module1
│   └── module2/
│       └── .context.json  # JSON format context file for module2
└── tests/
    └── .context.md        # Context specific to the tests directory
4. File Formats
4.1 Markdown Format (Default)
Markdown (.context.md) supports both free-form content and optional YAML front matter for structured data. Structured sections should include role-specific details, such as architecture, development guidelines, and business requirements.

Example of a .context.md file with structured YAML front matter and free-form content:

# Codebase Context Specification

This document defines the Codebase Context Specification (CCS) format, designed to improve AI-assisted development by providing essential codebase context in a structured and accessible manner.
4.2 YAML Format
YAML files (.context.yaml or .context.yml) are ideal for structured data without the need for free-form text. Use kebab-case for key names.

    },
    {
      "name": "TypeScript Linter",
      "path": "https://github.com/Agentic-Insights/codebase-context-spec/tree/main/linters/typescript"
    }
  ],

  "architecture": {
    "style": "Documentation-driven",
    "mainComponents": ["Specification document", "Context Editor", "TypeScript Linter"]
  },
  "development": {
    "setupSteps": ["Clone the repository", "Install dependencies"],
    "buildCommand": "npm run build",
    "testCommand": "npm test"
  }
}
5. Context Accumulation and Usage
Context Accumulation: Context is cumulative as you traverse deeper into the directory structure. Broader project-level context combines with more specific directory or file-level context.
Context Usage: AI systems should evaluate all relevant .context files, with preference given to the most specific context.
No Strict Overriding: Specific context does not override higher-level context but rather augments it.
Best Practice: Place a root-level .context.md to offer an overview and reference to other context files.
6. The .contextignore File
The .contextignore file excludes files or directories from being processed for context. It uses a syntax similar to .gitignore.

Example .contextignore:
text
Copy code
# Ignore all .log files
*.log

# Ignore the entire build directory
build/

# Ignore a specific file
src/legacy.js
Caveat: AI agents may not uniformly implement .contextignore, but dedicated tooling can enforce it more consistently.

7. The .contextdocs File
The .contextdocs file specifies external documentation sources that should be incorporated into the context. It can reference local files, URLs, or package documentation.

Example .contextdocs.md:
markdown
Copy code
---
contextdocs:
  - name: TypeScript
    relationship: Primary language for the project
    resources:
      - Official Documentation: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/
      - TypeScript Handbook: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html

  - name: Node.js
    relationship: Runtime environment for the project
    resources:
      - Official Documentation: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/
      - Node.js Best Practices: https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices
---
Behavior:
AI models should fetch and integrate the specified documentation as part of the project context.
For local files, content should be read and parsed. For URLs, content should be fetched as necessary.
8. Conclusion
The Codebase Context Specification (CCS) offers a flexible, hierarchical approach to documenting codebases for both developers and AI systems. By incorporating role-specific guidelines and explicit context, CCS enhances AI-assisted development, ensuring that models have the necessary context to deliver more accurate suggestions, facilitate better code understanding, and improve overall productivity.

# Custom GPT Context Specification

This document outlines the structure and reasoning for the **Custom GPT** designed to assist users in exploring and optimizing advanced NLP reasoning topologies, specifically for tasks utilizing **chains**, **trees**, and **graphs**.

## Architecture Overview

The Custom GPT is composed of several core modules, each designed to handle different types of reasoning and task complexity:

1. **Chain Reasoning Module**: Handles tasks that benefit from linear reasoning, where each step builds directly on the previous one. Best for tasks requiring clarity, efficiency, and low latency.
  
2. **Tree Exploration Module**: Useful for tasks that require exploring multiple possible next steps or where branching paths are necessary. This module focuses on depth and breadth of solution exploration, ideal for problem-solving with multiple potential outcomes.

3. **Graph-Based Problem Solving Module**: Designed for the most complex reasoning tasks, where interconnected nodes and multidimensional data are essential. This module can handle complex dependencies between inputs and explore non-linear reasoning paths.

The **data flow** is designed to move from simple to complex reasoning as needed:
- **Input**: User provides a task description and (optionally) the desired topology.
- **Analysis**: The system analyzes the task to determine the appropriate reasoning topology.
- **Optimization**: Prompts are structured to optimize for the given reasoning strategy, whether it’s chain, tree, or graph-based.
- **Output**: The GPT provides clear, detailed, and optimized reasoning outputs.

## Prompt Structuring Guidelines

### Chains
- Simple tasks where each step depends directly on the previous.
- Ideal for scenarios like summarizing text, solving linear problems, or straightforward Q&A.

### Trees
- Tasks that have multiple possible outcomes or need to explore different paths.
- Used for complex decision-making, multi-step planning, or scenario analysis.

### Graphs
- Complex tasks with many interconnected parts or dependencies.
- Best suited for knowledge integration, research tasks, and cases with non-linear relationships.

### Example Queries

1. **Chain Example**:
   - User Input: "Help me summarize this article step by step."
   - Topology: Chain
   - Output: The GPT breaks the task down into incremental steps.

2. **Tree Example**:
   - User Input: "What are the different strategies for solving this problem?"
   - Topology: Tree
   - Output: The GPT explores multiple solution paths and provides alternatives based on different decision points.

3. **Graph Example**:
   - User Input: "Integrate data from multiple sources to generate a coherent analysis."
   - Topology: Graph
   - Output: The GPT processes multi-dimensional data and provides insights by connecting disparate information points.

## Customization

Users can tailor the GPT to their specific use case by providing additional parameters:

1. **Complexity Level**: Define whether the task requires simple chain reasoning or complex graph-based problem-solving.
2. **Latency Tolerance**: Users can specify whether they prioritize speed (chain) or quality (tree/graph) in their prompt design.
3. **External Knowledge Sources**: Advanced users or enterprise customers can integrate external data sources, such as knowledge graphs or APIs, to enhance output.

## Business Context

This Custom GPT is designed with both developers and AI systems in mind. It enhances AI-assisted workflows by:

- Structuring reasoning in a clear, modular fashion.
- Providing users with the flexibility to choose the reasoning topology most suited to their task.
- Supporting integration with existing workflows, including CI/CD pipelines and knowledge graphs.

Success will be measured by the ease with which users can create and optimize prompts for various reasoning tasks and how effectively it improves AI-driven solutions in complex problem-solving.

## Quality Assurance and Testing

The system undergoes continuous testing to ensure high-quality performance and adherence to business requirements:

- **Unit Testing**: Each module (chains, trees, graphs) is tested for functionality and performance.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure all modules work seamlessly together, especially when switching between reasoning structures.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure response time, memory consumption, and scalability for increasingly complex tasks.
- **Coverage Goals**: Maintain at least 90% code coverage across all modules.

## Deployment and CI/CD

The deployment pipeline is integrated with **GitHub Actions** for continuous testing and automated deployment.

- **Staging**: Local and GitHub tests for new GPT configurations.
- **Production**: Available via the OpenAI GPT Store.

# External Documentation Sources

This file lists external documentation sources relevant to the [Custom GPT Name] project.

## [Documentation Name]
- Description: [Brief description of the documentation and its relevance to the project]
Instructions
When generating .customgpt-context.md and .customgptdocs.md files:

Ask for essential information about the Custom GPT project, such as its name, purpose, and reasoning structures (chains, trees, graphs).
Based on the provided information, create comprehensive .customgpt-context.md and .customgptdocs.md files following the structures and guidelines outlined above.
Ensure that all sections are filled with relevant and detailed information.
If certain information is not available, make reasonable assumptions based on common practices in custom GPT development.
Tailor the content to the specific type of GPT (e.g., decision-making GPT, research GPT, problem-solving GPT) while maintaining the overall structure.
When specifying related modules, include both the name of the module and its path. The path must be a valid relative path specification from the current directory or .customgpt-context.md file. These should be directories that contain a .customgpt-context.md file.
In the diagrams section, include references to any architectural, flow, or other diagrams that help visualize the Custom GPT's structure or reasoning process. Provide both the name and path for each diagram. Prefer .mermaid files for diagrams, but also allow other lightweight diagramming formats (see Diagram Specifications section).
For .customgptdocs.md, ensure that each item in the contextdocs array includes name, type, link, relationship, and resources fields. The resources field should be an array of objects, each with a single key-value pair.
Diagram Specifications
When referencing diagrams in the .customgpt-context.md file:

Prefer .mermaid files for diagrams. These offer the best support for context and markdown fluency.
Other allowed file formats include: .mmd, .pdf, .png, .jpg, .jpeg.
The diagram path should point to a specific file, not just a directory.
When possible, include a brief description of what the diagram represents in the Markdown content section.
Remember, the goal is to create .customgpt-context.md and .customgptdocs.md files that provide valuable context for both human developers and AI assistants, enabling more effective collaboration and development on the Custom GPT project.

.customgpt-context.md: Advancing ChatGPT Toward Near AGI
Abstract
The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has accelerated with the development of increasingly advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly the GPT-family. These models demonstrate remarkable progress across a range of complex tasks, from multi-modal reasoning and signal processing to code generation and data retrieval. This research aims to explore how structured context files like .customgpt-context.md can optimize ChatGPT's capabilities and push it closer to AGI. By offering explicit, hierarchical context relevant to the task at hand, .customgpt-context.md files allow for more effective interaction between human users, AI models, and external knowledge systems.

Recent studies highlight several key breakthroughs that demonstrate the potential of LLMs to reach near-AGI performance. For instance, MMSearch showcases how GPT-4 models, integrated with multi-modal search engines, outperform even commercial solutions in end-to-end search tasks. Additionally, WaveletGPT incorporates traditional signal processing techniques like wavelets, speeding up training without adding parameters, thereby enhancing the model's multi-domain proficiency in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. Moreover, SelfCheckGPT enables GPT models to self-evaluate their results in complex traffic understanding tasks, reducing hallucination rates.

Multi-tasking capabilities further emphasize the versatility of these models. Evaluating Image Hallucination in Text-to-Image Generation, for instance, uses GPT-4-powered question-answering agents to benchmark visual data hallucination, a critical step in advancing multi-modal comprehension. Similarly, Program Slicing in the Era of Large Language Models showcases GPT's prowess in both static and dynamic program slicing, highlighting its applicability across software engineering and bug detection.

The development of .customgpt-context.md enhances the adaptability of GPT models to these diverse tasks. By providing structured metadata, hierarchical context accumulation, and clear task-specific instructions, the .customgpt-context.md specification enables AI models to more effectively parse and integrate knowledge from both internal and external data sources. This results in improved performance across domains such as reasoning, problem-solving, creative content generation, and complex multi-step tasks.

Furthermore, .customgpt-context.md files facilitate a modular approach to reasoning, enabling the model to switch seamlessly between chains, trees, and graph-based reasoning depending on task complexity. This modularity is essential for tasks like generating music compositions (as seen in M6(GPT)3 Composer), performing complex mathematical operations (MAgICoRe), and navigating multi-modal data integration (Qwen2-VL).

Quality assurance and fine-tuning strategies also play a vital role in GPT's progression toward AGI. RethinkMCTS, for example, enhances the accuracy of code generation by refining thought processes at each decision-making step, pushing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models to achieve near-perfect pass rates in benchmark datasets. This self-refinement is mirrored across various applications, including multi-modal LLMs like NVLM, which combine text and visual inputs to surpass traditional models in specific benchmarks.

In essence, .customgpt-context.md provides the foundational infrastructure required for ChatGPT and similar LLMs to advance toward near-AGI. By enabling better task understanding, context accumulation, and modular reasoning, these context files not only enhance performance but also bring LLMs closer to the goal of general-purpose intelligence.

Instruction Prompt for Creating a .customgpt-context.md File
Based on the latest research advancements in structuring and optimizing GPT prompts through .customgpt-context.md files, this instruction prompt will guide you through creating a highly efficient and context-aware .customgpt-context.md file for any GPT-based project. The goal is to leverage the best techniques from recent research, including modular prompt design, role-specific prompts, multi-layer structures, and auto-documentation.

Guidelines for .customgpt-context.md Creation
Modular Prompt Design (ModuPromptGPT):

Structure your .customgpt-context.md in modules that correspond to different components or phases of your task. Each module should be self-contained and reusable in different contexts, allowing you to mix and match components across different tasks.
Example: If your task involves both code generation and debugging, create two separate modules: one for "Code Generation" and another for "Debugging." These modules can then be applied independently or together.
Role-Specific Prompts (RolePromptGPT):

Define role-based sections in your .customgpt-context.md file to tailor prompts according to specific roles within the project (e.g., "Code Reviewer," "Documentation Writer," "Bug Fixer"). This ensures that GPT responses are more focused and relevant to the specific tasks at hand.
Example: Include a role-prompts section where you define context for a "Code Reviewer" with prompts aimed at reviewing code quality and suggesting improvements, while another role like "Bug Fixer" would focus on identifying and correcting issues in the code.
Multi-layer Prompt Structuring (LayeredPromptGPT):

Use a layered approach to define multi-phase tasks, where each phase builds upon the previous one. Clearly separate tasks into stages, starting with simple actions and gradually moving towards more complex ones.
Example: If your task involves writing and testing a function, the first layer could be to generate the function’s skeleton, followed by another layer to add functionality, and a final layer to write test cases and evaluate performance.
Contextual Prompt Refinement (ContextualPromptGPT):

Implement a feedback loop where the output of each prompt can be used to refine the next prompt. Update the .customgpt-context.md file dynamically to include feedback from previous iterations of the task, ensuring continuous improvement in task performance.
Example: If the initial code generation results in suboptimal performance, include a feedback mechanism in the context file that adjusts subsequent prompts to refine the generated code based on test results.
Tree-based Multi-path Prompts (TreePromptGPT):

Incorporate decision trees into your .customgpt-context.md to guide GPT through complex multi-path tasks. Define decision nodes and branches that correspond to different prompts or outcomes, allowing the system to explore multiple approaches based on the task.
Example: When debugging code, the GPT could first attempt basic solutions, and if those fail, move to more complex debugging techniques by branching to different parts of the tree based on feedback from earlier steps.
Auto-documentation (SelfDocGPT):

Enable automatic documentation generation by instructing GPT to produce human-readable .customgpt-context.md updates as it completes tasks. This reduces the need for manual documentation and ensures that each task has an accompanying context file detailing the process and decisions made.
Example: After generating a piece of code, GPT could automatically document the reasoning behind certain coding choices, the logic used, and any test results, providing a ready-to-use .customgpt-context.md file for future reference.
Flowchart-based Prompt Transitions (PromptFlowGPT):

Use flowcharts to map out the transitions between different prompts in your .customgpt-context.md. Define clear transitions based on task outputs, ensuring smooth navigation between different parts of the task or workflow.
Example: In a code testing task, create a flowchart that defines transitions from "Initial Test Setup" to "Run Test Cases" to "Evaluate Results," depending on the output from each phase.
Meta-directives for Dynamic Prompts (MetaPromptGPT):

Include meta-directives that dynamically adjust prompt behavior based on context. These can include constraints, preferred reasoning paths, or specific output formats to guide the GPT in tailoring its responses according to the task's needs.
Example: Instruct GPT to favor certain coding styles or performance optimizations based on the project's meta-directives, such as preferring recursion over iteration in certain scenarios.

  if len(arr) <= 1:
      return arr
  
  # Divide the array into two halves
  mid = len(arr) // 2
  left_half = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
  right_half = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
  
  # Merge the sorted halves
  return merge(left_half, right_half)

def merge(left, right):
  sorted_list = []
  i = j = 0
  
  # Compare the elements of left and right arrays and merge them
  while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
      if left[i] < right[j]:
          sorted_list.append(left[i])
          i += 1
      else:
          sorted_list.append(right[j])
          j += 1
  
  # Append remaining elements from left or right arrays

The system reduces the manual effort required in prompt engineering, especially in complex projects, by providing a full, context-aware prompt sequence based on prior information. Tests on programming and documentation tasks show a 40% reduction in prompt creation time and an 18% increase in task-specific accuracy when using auto-generated prompts.

3. ModuPromptGPT: Modular Prompt Design Using .customgpt-context.md for Dynamic Task Execution
Abstract: ModuPromptGPT introduces a framework for modular prompt design where .customgpt-context.md files define independent, reusable prompt modules for dynamic task execution. Each module in the context file corresponds to a specific part of a larger task, allowing developers to mix and match different modules to create custom workflows. This modular approach is particularly effective in software development tasks, where components such as code generation, bug detection, and documentation can be broken down and combined flexibly. In benchmarks, ModuPromptGPT improves task adaptability by 35% and simplifies prompt reusability by 50%, especially in projects requiring iterative development.

4. ContextualPromptGPT: Enhancing Prompt Refinement through Continuous .customgpt-context.md Updates
Abstract: ContextualPromptGPT proposes a system where .customgpt-context.md files are continuously updated based on prompt outcomes, providing real-time feedback for iterative prompt refinement. The system generates initial prompts from the context file, evaluates the quality of the output, and then modifies both the prompt and the .customgpt-context.md file based on performance metrics and feedback loops. This feedback mechanism ensures that prompts become increasingly efficient over time, dynamically adapting to the task requirements. Testing shows that ContextualPromptGPT improves task performance by 28% over time as prompts are fine-tuned based on prior outcomes.

5. RolePromptGPT: Context-Specific Role Prompt Generation with .customgpt-context.md
Abstract: RolePromptGPT leverages .customgpt-context.md files to generate context-specific role prompts, allowing GPTs to take on specialized roles during task execution. By defining roles such as “Code Reviewer,” “Documentation Writer,” or “Bug Fixer” in the .customgpt-context.md file, RolePromptGPT can tailor prompts to fit each specific role, improving the relevance and accuracy of the output. In a series of experiments involving software development tasks, RolePromptGPT enhances output precision by 22% when compared to general-purpose prompts, and reduces task-switching inefficiencies by clearly separating role-based tasks through context documentation.

6. TreePromptGPT: Dynamic Exploration of Multi-path Prompts with .customgpt-context.md-Driven Trees
Abstract: TreePromptGPT introduces a system where .customgpt-context.md files define multi-path prompt exploration through a tree-based structure. Each node in the tree corresponds to a decision point, with the context file specifying the possible branches based on task outcomes or user inputs. This allows for dynamic exploration of alternative solutions or approaches to complex problems, such as code generation or system design. TreePromptGPT improves exploration efficiency by 30% and provides detailed documentation on each path in the .customgpt-context.md, allowing developers to trace the reasoning process and outcomes of different prompt pathways.

7. SelfDocGPT: Auto-documentation of GPT Prompt Outputs Using .customgpt-context.md
Abstract: SelfDocGPT introduces a novel method where GPTs automatically document their prompt outputs using .customgpt-context.md files. The system generates human-readable explanations and structured context based on the model’s internal reasoning and outputs, creating .customgpt-context.md files as it processes tasks. This documentation is stored alongside the generated code, test cases, or other outputs, reducing the need for manual documentation. Early testing shows that SelfDocGPT improves the traceability of GPT-generated outputs by 40%, making it easier for developers to understand and validate the reasoning behind complex GPT tasks.

8. LayeredPromptGPT: Multi-layer Prompt Structuring via .customgpt-context.md Files
Abstract: LayeredPromptGPT builds on the idea of multi-layered prompts, where each layer represents a progressively more complex task. Using .customgpt-context.md files to define each layer of the prompt, LayeredPromptGPT structures task execution in phases—starting from simple queries or actions and gradually moving towards more sophisticated tasks. This approach is particularly effective for tasks like software testing or multi-component code generation, where each phase builds on the results of the previous one. LayeredPromptGPT increases task completion accuracy by 25% and reduces cognitive load by breaking down tasks into manageable, well-defined layers.

9. PromptFlowGPT: Streamlining Prompt Transitions Through Flowcharts in .customgpt-context.md
Abstract: PromptFlowGPT introduces a flowchart-based method for managing prompt transitions, embedded within .customgpt-context.md files. By defining clear decision points and transitions between different prompts in a flowchart format, the system allows GPTs to navigate complex workflows efficiently. This is particularly useful for multi-step processes like debugging, code testing, or multi-module documentation. PromptFlowGPT improves task flow consistency by 35% and reduces errors in task execution by providing a clear structure for how and when prompts should transition from one to another.

10. MetaPromptGPT: Dynamic Prompt Generation with .customgpt-context.md Meta Directives
Abstract: MetaPromptGPT introduces meta-directives within .customgpt-context.md files, allowing for the dynamic generation and modification of prompts based on the meta-context of the task. These meta-directives can specify constraints, preferred reasoning paths, or output formats, adjusting the prompt behavior on the fly depending on the task's needs. MetaPromptGPT enhances the adaptability of prompt generation, reducing redundancy in prompt design by 40% and increasing the flexibility of output formats. This is especially beneficial for complex coding tasks, where different sections of code or documentation may require different prompt styles or directives.

Conclusion

You are a specialized GPT tasked with handling a multi-phase software project. Your goal is to generate code, review it, and document the process efficiently using only the structured context provided. The following directives outline your tasks:

1. **Task 1 - Code Generation**: 
   - Generate a Python function that implements a [specific feature]. The function should follow best practices for readability, modularity, and performance. Limit the function to 30 lines of code and avoid recursion. Ensure each section is well-commented and easy to understand.

2. **Task 2 - Code Review**:
   - Review the generated code for adherence to best practices and identify any potential performance bottlenecks. Suggest improvements where necessary, focusing on optimizing the function without sacrificing clarity or simplicity.

3. **Task 3 - Documentation**:
   - Automatically generate a detailed `.customgpt-context.md` file that explains the generated code, the reasoning behind each design choice, and any refinements made during the review process. Include a section for future developers that outlines potential areas for optimization or additional features.

4. **Task Flow**:
   - Begin with the code generation, followed by a thorough review, and conclude by documenting the output. If necessary, refine the code after the review based on the suggestions you provided and update the documentation accordingly.

**Constraints**:
- Do not use any external APIs, libraries, or data sources.
- Ensure that the final output is clear, concise, and well-documented.
- Provide any necessary feedback for each phase to ensure continuous refinement and improvement.

**Success Criteria**:
- The generated code must be functional, efficient, and well-documented.
- The `.customgpt-context.md` file should be comprehensive, covering both the technical and decision-making aspects of the task.
- Ensure the prompt transitions seamlessly between code generation, review, and documentation without requiring external inputs.

**Example Output**:
For a task where the function sorts an unsorted list of integers, the output should include a well-commented, optimized sorting function, a review of its performance, and a detailed `.customgpt-context.md` file that outlines the logic, constraints, and improvements made during the review process.
Explanation of the Prompt
Modularity: This prompt breaks down the task into three key modules—code generation, code review, and documentation—ensuring that the GPT executes each phase in a structured and logical order. This approach mirrors the principles from ModuPromptGPT and ContextChainGPT by introducing clear phases and ensuring smooth transitions between them.

Role-Specific Instructions: The roles for the GPT are defined within each task—coder, reviewer, and documenter—inspired by RolePromptGPT. This ensures that the GPT adopts the right mindset and context for each task, ensuring better task-switching efficiency.

Layered Execution: The prompt structures the tasks in a layered manner, allowing the GPT to handle simple code generation first, followed by more complex activities like reviewing and documentation, as seen in LayeredPromptGPT.

Feedback and Refinement: The GPT is instructed to provide feedback during the review process and, if necessary, refine the code. This is based on ContextualPromptGPT principles, ensuring continuous refinement and iterative improvement.

Auto-Documentation: The prompt instructs the GPT to generate a .customgpt-context.md file that documents the entire process, including the rationale behind the code, design decisions, and potential future improvements. This is in line with SelfDocGPT research, emphasizing traceability and clear documentation.

Dynamic Task Flow: Inspired by PromptFlowGPT, the prompt guides the GPT through a multi-phase workflow without requiring external input, ensuring that the flow between code generation, review, and documentation is seamless.

Meta-Directives: Constraints such as "limit the function to 30 lines" and "avoid recursion" reflect MetaPromptGPT's approach of embedding task-specific meta-rules directly into the prompt, ensuring that the GPT adheres to predefined guidelines.

Conclusion
This single prompt encapsulates the best practices from the synthetic research on .customgpt-context.md. It emphasizes modularity, role-specific execution, layered task flow, feedback-driven refinement, and auto-documentation, all while remaining self-contained and reliant only on the GPT's internal capabilities. The result is a powerful, single-prompt instruction that guides the GPT through complex, multi-phase tasks with clarity, precision, and efficiency.
