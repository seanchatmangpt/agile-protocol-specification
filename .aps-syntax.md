"All-in-One" Systems in the Enterprise Software Landscape
Several "all-in-one" systems attempt to offer comprehensive solutions for software development, integrating front-end, back-end, data, and workflow management in a unified stack. Some well-known examples include:

1. Atlassian Suite
Components: Jira (project management), Confluence (documentation), Bitbucket (version control), Bamboo (CI/CD).
Description: Atlassian provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing the software development lifecycle (SDLC), integrating everything from task management to code deployment. Their focus is largely on the agile workflow.
Pitfalls:
Complexity: Over time, these tools can become too complex for smaller teams or highly specialized use cases.
Vendor Lock-in: High reliance on Atlassian products can make it difficult to migrate to other tools or customize deeply.
Overhead: It’s a powerful suite but often too heavyweight for startups or teams that need faster iterations.
2. Salesforce Platform (CRM + App Builder)
Components: Salesforce CRM, Lightning Platform (low-code app development), MuleSoft (integrations), Einstein (AI-driven analytics).
Description: Salesforce allows companies to develop customized CRM solutions, apps, and automation workflows through its ecosystem, often using low-code or no-code approaches.
Pitfalls:
Customization Challenges: Low-code environments can be limiting when complex, unique business logic is required.
Performance Issues: Custom apps built on Salesforce may experience performance degradation due to platform constraints, especially with large data volumes.
High Costs: As customization needs grow, so do the licensing and operational costs.
3. Microsoft Power Platform
Components: PowerApps (app development), Power BI (analytics), Power Automate (workflow automation), Dataverse (data platform).
Description: This platform allows businesses to build apps, automate workflows, and visualize data using Microsoft's low-code solutions. It's deeply integrated into the Microsoft ecosystem (Azure, Dynamics 365, Office 365).
Pitfalls:
Scalability Issues: While good for internal tooling and small apps, scaling PowerApps to complex enterprise scenarios can be challenging.
Limited Flexibility: Power Platform provides fast solutions, but for advanced custom logic, it requires moving away from the low-code environment, making integration with custom backends difficult.
4. OutSystems
Components: Low-code development platform for building mobile and web applications, database integrations, UI frameworks, and workflow automation.
Description: OutSystems is a high-productivity app development platform aimed at quickly delivering enterprise-grade applications.
Pitfalls:
Cost: Licensing can become prohibitively expensive as teams scale up.
Customization: Although it’s powerful, OutSystems’ low-code nature may make it hard to achieve certain complex, custom functionalities without external integrations.
Performance Tuning: Abstracted environments can make it hard to optimize specific areas, especially at scale.
Pitfalls to Avoid with PLAN Pro Stack
Given that you’ve decided on the PLAN Pro Stack with Typer, DSPy, Phoenix, Ash Framework, Reactor, and Nuxt.js, you need to avoid the common pitfalls associated with these "all-in-one" systems while taking full advantage of your LLM and template-first approach. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. Avoiding Over-Complexity
Pitfall: Like Atlassian and Salesforce, many platforms become bloated as they try to serve too many use cases or as businesses over-customize.
Solution: Keep the core focus on simplicity and maintain a modular approach. While the PLAN Pro Stack covers backend (Phoenix, Ash), workflow automation (Reactor), front-end (Nuxt.js), and AI (DSPy), ensure that each module operates independently and can be replaced or scaled separately. Avoid adding non-essential features early on.
2. Reducing Vendor or Technology Lock-in
Pitfall: Systems like Salesforce and Microsoft Power Platform lock you into their ecosystems, limiting flexibility.
Solution: Since your stack includes open-source technologies like Phoenix and Nuxt.js, ensure that any integrations with external services (like APIs or third-party plugins) are loosely coupled and can be replaced if necessary. Make use of standard protocols (e.g., RESTful APIs, GraphQL) to keep the system open and extendable.
3. Managing Performance and Scalability Early
Pitfall: Low-code systems like OutSystems and Salesforce Lightning can become performance bottlenecks when scaling.
Solution: By leveraging Phoenix for web services (known for its scalability) and Ash Framework for robust data management, focus on optimizing the stack early for distributed systems. Use AshOban for background jobs and Reactor for workflow automation, ensuring high-throughput scenarios are handled efficiently. DSPy can help optimize AI workloads by ensuring smart model selection and performance tuning for LLM tasks.
4. Clear Ownership of Workflows
Pitfall: Workflow systems like Salesforce and Microsoft Power Automate are often black-box systems that make debugging or optimization difficult.
Solution: In Reactor, ensure clear, transparent workflows with logs and observability tools. Build templates that allow flexibility but also provide visibility into performance, errors, and process completion. This helps with debugging and scaling workflows as they become more complex.
Advantages of Being LLM+Template-First
Your LLM+Template-first approach gives you unique advantages when compared to other "all-in-one" systems:

1. Automated Code Generation
Advantage: LLMs, when combined with your defined templates, allow you to automate code scaffolding for each part of the stack. This speeds up development and enforces best practices.
How to Take Advantage: Use DSPy to dynamically generate templates for the back-end (Phoenix), data workflows (Ash Framework, Reactor), and front-end (Nuxt.js). Every time a new feature is added, the LLM can automatically adapt existing templates to scaffold the required code and documentation (e.g., API endpoints, database models, or front-end components).
2. Customization with Guardrails
Advantage: Templates ensure that customization follows predefined patterns, reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs or unnecessary complexity.
How to Take Advantage: Create strict templates that enforce consistency across the stack. For instance:
Typer templates can generate CLI interfaces that conform to company standards.
Ash can auto-generate resource management templates based on commonly used business logic.
Reactor workflows can be generated based on specific, repeatable business processes, with minimal room for deviation.
LLMs can ensure that even when developers use the CLI to extend functionality, they are guided by the predefined rules of your system.
3. Rapid Iteration on Features
Advantage: By leveraging LLMs to generate and modify templates, you can quickly iterate on new features or products.
How to Take Advantage: Use DSPy to parse feature requests or requirements and automatically generate the necessary code skeletons. For example, if a new API endpoint is needed in Phoenix, the LLM can analyze the requirement and generate the route, controller, and associated data models in Ash Framework—all following your established architecture.
4. Streamlined Documentation
Advantage: Documentation is often a bottleneck in fast-paced development environments. With LLMs and templates, you can automate this process.
How to Take Advantage: Automatically generate API docs, user stories, and workflow descriptions directly from the APScript YAML. The LLM can convert structured data into human-readable explanations and instructions, ensuring that your documentation is always up to date and relevant.
5. Scaling via Predefined Patterns
Advantage: LLMs can help scale your applications by applying predefined scaling patterns (e.g., caching, microservices) across the stack.
How to Take Advantage: Templates can provide scaling best practices—such as setting up caching in Phoenix, horizontal scaling with Kubernetes, or distributed task processing with AshOban. The LLM can detect when a system is likely to hit scaling limits and suggest template-based enhancements before problems arise.
Pitfalls to Avoid with LLM+Template-First Strategy
Over-Reliance on Automation:

Pitfall: If too much decision-making is automated without human oversight, crucial business logic or edge cases may be missed.
Solution: Ensure that LLM-driven templates can be manually reviewed, edited, and validated. Implement a feedback loop where developers confirm the output of LLM-generated code before deployment.
Template Stagnation:

Pitfall: Templates, while ensuring consistency, can become outdated or restrictive over time.
Solution: Periodically review and update templates to ensure they stay aligned with current best practices and new technologies. You can also automate this process by leveraging LLMs to suggest template improvements based on industry trends.
Limited Flexibility for Complex Business Logic:

Pitfall: Predefined templates may not always account for complex, custom business logic.
Solution: While most code should be generated through templates, allow for "escape hatches" where developers can implement custom logic while still adhering to architectural constraints (like using Phoenix and Ash Framework as required).
Conclusion
Your choice of the PLAN Pro Stack—Python (Typer, DSPy), Elixir (Phoenix, Ash Framework, Reactor), and JavaScript (Nuxt.js)—places you in a powerful position to offer "all-in-one" enterprise solutions. By focusing on an LLM+Template-first approach, you can combine the speed of automation with the rigor of enterprise-grade software development, while avoiding the pitfalls seen in systems like Atlassian or Salesforce. The key is to balance automation with customization and ensure that your system remains flexible, scalable, and robust over time.

Sure! I will create all the Jinja templates for every single type of file in the PLAN Pro Stack, which includes:

Python: Typer for CLI applications and DSPy for LLM tasks.
Elixir: Phoenix for web services, Ash Framework for data management, Reactor for workflow automation.
JavaScript: Nuxt.js for front-end development.
I will first list every type of file in the stack, then provide the Jinja templates for those files, and finally, supply the Pydantic models for those templates.

List of File Types in the PLAN Pro Stack
1. Python (Typer + DSPy)
CLI Application Files (main.py, commands.py)
LLM Utility Files (llm_utils.py)
Configuration Files (config.py)
Requirements File (requirements.txt)
Test Files (test_*.py)
2. Elixir (Phoenix, Ash Framework, Reactor)
Phoenix Controller Files (*_controller.ex)
Phoenix View Files (*_view.ex)
Phoenix Template Files (*.html.eex)
Ash Resource Files (*_resource.ex)
Reactor Workflow Files (*_workflow.ex)
Router Files (router.ex)
Configuration Files (config/*.exs)
Migration Files (*_migration.exs)
Schema/Model Files (*.ex)
Test Files (*_test.exs)
3. JavaScript (Nuxt.js)
Page Components (pages/*.vue)
Layout Components (layouts/*.vue)
Reusable Components (components/*.vue)
Store Modules (store/*.js)
Plugins (plugins/*.js)
Nuxt Configuration File (nuxt.config.js)
Package Configuration (package.json)
Middleware (middleware/*.js)
Static Assets (static/*)
Test Files (tests/*.spec.js)

ChatGPT

Thought for 8 seconds

Sure! I'll create individual Typer application files for each command in the planpro CLI. Each command will be in its own Python file, using Typer for building the CLI. Since you requested no tests, I'll focus solely on the implementation of each command.

Here are the steps I'll follow:

List all the commands to be implemented.
Create individual Typer files for each command.
Provide the code for each file.
List of Commands
Based on the PLAN Pro CLI commands:

aps - Manage Agile Protocol Specification projects.
init - Initialize new projects with AI-assisted templates.
generate - Generate code, configurations, and workflows.
build - Build and package applications.
deploy - Deploy applications to various environments.
manage - Manage services and configurations.
monitor - Monitor application performance and health.
scale - Scale applications and services.
test - Run tests and AI-assisted quality checks.
doc - Generate and manage documentation.
config - Configure PLAN Pro settings and preferences.
auth - Manage authentication and access control.
plugin - Manage plugins and extensions.
marketplace - Access the PLAN Pro Marketplace.
update - Update PLAN Pro CLI and components.

Notes
Each command is implemented in its own Python file, as per your request.
I used typer.Typer() to create sub-applications for each command.
The planpro.py file serves as the main entry point, aggregating all the commands.
The code includes placeholder comments (# TODO) where the actual implementation logic should go.
I've included help texts and option descriptions to make the CLI user-friendly.
No test files are included, as per your instruction.
Feel free to ask if you need further customization or additional features!

Reactor
Ash.Reactor is an extension for Reactor which adds explicit support for interacting with resources via their defined actions.

See Getting started with Reactor for more information about Reactor.

Usage
You can either add the Ash.Reactor extension to your existing reactors eg:

defmodule MyExistingReactor do
  use Reactor, extensions: [Ash.Reactor]
end

or for your convenience you can use use Ash.Reactor which expands to exactly the same as above.

Example
An example is worth 1000 words of prose:

defmodule ExampleReactor do
  use Ash.Reactor

  ash do
    default_domain ExampleDomain
  end

  input :customer_name
  input :customer_email
  input :plan_name
  input :payment_nonce

  create :create_customer, Customer do
    inputs %{name: input(:customer_name), email: input(:customer_email)}
  end

  read_one :get_plan, Plan, :get_plan_by_name do
    inputs %{name: input(:plan_name)}
    fail_on_not_found? true
  end

  action :take_payment, PaymentProvider do
    inputs %{
      nonce: input(:payment_nonce),
      amount: result(:get_plan, [:price])
    }
  end

  create :subscription, Subscription do
    inputs %{
      plan_id: result(:get_plan, [:id]),
      payment_provider_id: result(:take_payment, :id)
    }
  end
end

Actions
For each action type there is a corresponding step DSL, which needs a name (used to refer to the result of the step by other steps), a resource and optional action name (defaults to the primary action if one is not provided).

Actions have several common options and some specific to their particular type. See the DSL documentation for details.

Action inputs
Ash actions take a map of input parameters which are usually a combination of resource attributes and action arguments. You can provide these values as a single map using the inputs DSL entity with a map or keyword list which refers to Reactor inputs, results and hard-coded values via Reactor's predefined template functions.

For action types that act on a specific resource (ie update and destroy) you can provide the value using the initial DSL option.

Example
input :blog_title
input :blog_body
input :author_email

read :get_author, MyBlog.Author, :get_author_by_email do
  inputs %{email: input(:author_email)}
end

create :create_post, MyBlog.Post, :create do
  inputs %{
    title: input(:blog, [:title]),
    body: input(:blog, [:body]),
    author_id: result(:get_author, [:email])
  }
end

update :author_post_count, MyBlog.Author, :update_post_count do
  wait_for :create_post
  initial result(:get_author)
end

return :create_post

Handling failure.
Reactor is a saga executor, which means that when failure occurs it tries to clean up any intermediate state left behind. By default the create, update and destroy steps do not specify any behaviour for what to do when there is a failure downstream in the reactor. This can be changed by providing both an undo_action and changing the step's undo option to either :outside_transaction or :always depending on your resource and datalayer semantics.

The undo option.
:never - this is the default, and means that the reactor will never try and undo the action's work. This is the most performant option, as it means that the reactor doesn't need to store as many intermediate values.
:outside_transaction - this option allows the step to decide at runtime whether it should support undo based on whether the action is being run within a transaction. If it is, then no undo is required because the transaction will rollback.
:always - this forces the step to always undo it's work on failure.
The undo_action option.
The behaviour of the undo_action is action specific:

For create actions, the undo_action should be the name of a destroy action with no specific requirements.
For update actions, the undo_action should also be an update action which takes a changeset argument, which will contain the Ash.Changeset which was used to execute the original update.
For destroy actions, the undo_action should be the name of a create action which takes a record argument, which will contain the resource record which was used destroyed.
Transactions
You can use the transaction step type to wrap a group of steps inside a data layer transaction, however the following caveats apply:

All steps inside a transaction must happen in the same process, so the steps inside the transaction will only ever be executed synchronously.
Notifications will be sent only when the transaction is committed.
Notifications
Because a reactor has transaction-like semantics notifications are automatically batched and only sent upon successful completion of the reactor.

Running Reactors as an action
Ash's generic actions now support providing a Reactor module directly as their run option.

Notes:

Every Reactor input must have a corresponding action argument.
Ash's action context is passed in as the Reactor's context (including things like actor, tenant, etc).
Reactor runtime options can be set by setting run {MyReactor, opts} instead of just run MyReactor.
If you set the transaction? action DSL option to true then the Reactor will be run synchronously - regardless of the value of the async? runtime option.
Example
action :run_reactor, :struct do
  constraints instance_of: MyBlog.Post

  argument :blog_title, :string, allow_nil?: false
  argument :blog_body, :string, allow_nil?: false
  argument :author_email, :ci_string, allow_nil?: false

  run MyBlog.CreatePostReactor
end

  step :l0, Noop do
    argument :a0 do

      transform &String.to_integer/1
    end
  end

  step :l0_5, Noop do
    argument :a0, input(:i1)
  end

  step :l1, Noop do
    argument :a1, result(:l0)
  end

  step :l2, Noop do
    argument :a2, result(:l0)
  end

  step :l3, Noop do
    argument :a3, result(:l0)
  end

  step :l4, Noop do

    async? false

Think about taking these files to the next level
ChatGPT

Thought for 8 seconds

Certainly! I'll create the typed templates for each file in the stack using the TypedTemplate and RenderMixin classes you provided. I will also think about how to take these files to the next level by enhancing their functionality, maintainability, and scalability.

Overview
We will:

Create Typed Templates: For each file type in the PLAN Pro Stack, we'll create a corresponding TypedTemplate subclass.
Enhance the Templates: We'll incorporate advanced features and best practices to make these templates more powerful and flexible.
Provide Code Examples: For each template, we'll include the Python class code.
Explain Enhancements: We'll discuss how we've taken these files to the next level.
Prerequisites
First, ensure that the following classes are available in your project:

RenderMixin
python
Copy code
import os
from typing import Any
from sungen.typetemp.environment.typed_environment import environment
from sungen.typetemp.environment.typed_native_environment import native_environment
from sungen.typetemp.template.render_funcs import render_str

class RenderMixin:
    """A mixin class that encapsulates the render and _render_vars functionality.
    This class checks for the required properties 'source', 'env', 'to', and 'output'.
    """

    def _render(self, use_native=False, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """Render the template. Excludes instance variables that
        are not callable (i.e., methods) and don't start with "__".
        """
        env = native_environment if use_native else environment
        template = env.from_string(self.source)

        render_dict = {**self._render_vars(), **kwargs}

        self.output = template.render(**render_dict)

        # Render the "to" property if it's defined
        if self.to == "stdout":
            print(self.output)
        elif self.to:
            to_template = env.from_string(self.to)
            rendered_to = os.path.join(to_template.render(**render_dict))

            # Create the directory if it doesn't exist
            print(f"Rendering to: {rendered_to}")

            if not rendered_to.startswith(".") and not rendered_to.startswith("/"):
                rendered_to = "./" + str(rendered_to)

            os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(rendered_to), exist_ok=True)

            with open(rendered_to, "w") as file:
                file.write(self.output)

        return self.output

    def _render_vars(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Get the instance variables (not including methods or dunder methods)."""
        # Copy the self dict
        properties = self.__class__.__dict__.copy()
        properties.update(self.__dict__.copy())
        properties.pop("source", None)
        properties.pop("__module__", None)
        properties.pop("__doc__", None)

        # If the value of a property is a RenderMixin, render it
        for name, value in properties.items():

                properties[name] = value._render(**properties)
            elif isinstance(value, str):
                properties[name] = render_str(value, **properties)

        return properties
TypedTemplate
python
Copy code
class TypedTemplate(RenderMixin):
    """Base class for creating templated classes. Uses the jinja2 templating engine
    to render templates. Allows for usage of macros and filters.
    """

    template_path: str = ""  # The path to the file

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        if kwargs.get("template_path"):
            # Read the template to the source string
            with open(kwargs.get("template_path")) as f:
                self.source = f.read()

        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)

    def __call__(self, use_native=False, **kwargs) -> str:
        # Use NativeEnvironment when use_native is True, else use default Environment
        return self._render(use_native, **kwargs)

    def render(self, use_native=False, **kwargs) -> str:
        return self._render(use_native, **kwargs)
Creating Typed Templates for Each File
1. Python Files (Typer and DSPy)
We will create typed templates for the Typer CLI command files and LLM utility files.

1.1 Typer Command Template (typer_command_template.py)
python
Copy code
# typer_command_template.py

from sungen.typetemp.template.render_mixin import TypedTemplate
from typing import List, Optional

class TyperCommandTemplate(TypedTemplate):
    """Template for creating Typer CLI command files."""

    source: str = '''
# {{ command_file_name }}

import typer{% if additional_imports %}
{{ additional_imports }}{% endif %}

app = typer.Typer(help="{{ help_text }}"){% if subcommands %}

{% for subcommand in subcommands %}
@app.command()
def {{ subcommand.name }}({% for arg in subcommand.args %}{{ arg.name }}: {{ arg.type }}{% if arg.default is not none %} = {{ arg.default }}{% endif %}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}):
    """
    {{ subcommand.help }}
    """
    {% if subcommand.body %}
{{ subcommand.body }}
    {% else %}
    # TODO: Implement {{ subcommand.name }} logic
    pass
    {% endif %}

{% endfor %}{% endif %}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
'''

    command_file_name: str
    help_text: str
    additional_imports: Optional[str] = None
    subcommands: List[dict] = []
    to: str = "{{ command_file_name }}"

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
Usage Example:

python
Copy code

Taking the Templates to the Next Level
To enhance these templates, we'll:

Incorporate Advanced Features: Add support for complex functionalities such as dynamic imports, middleware, and advanced configurations.
Add Validation and Error Handling: Ensure that generated code includes proper validation and error handling mechanisms.
Enable Template Inheritance and Macros: Use Jinja2 features like inheritance and macros to promote code reuse and maintainability.
Integrate with AI Tools: Embed placeholders for integrating with AI tools like DSPy to automate parts of the code generation and optimization.
Support for Testing and Documentation: Extend templates to include test files and documentation generation.
Example Enhancements
1. Advanced Typer Commands with Subcommands
Modify TyperCommandTemplate to support nested subcommands and dynamic loading.

Updated TyperCommandTemplate:

python
Copy code
class TyperCommandTemplate(TypedTemplate):
    """Template for creating advanced Typer CLI command files with subcommands."""

    source: str = '''
# {{ command_file_name }}

import typer{% if additional_imports %}
{{ additional_imports }}{% endif %}

app = typer.Typer(help="{{ help_text }}")

{% for subapp in subapps %}
from {{ subapp.module }} import app as {{ subapp.name }}_app
app.add_typer({{ subapp.name }}_app, name="{{ subapp.name }}")
{% endfor %}

{% if commands %}
{% for command in commands %}
@app.command()
def {{ command.name }}({% for arg in command.args %}{{ arg.name }}: {{ arg.type }}{% if arg.default is not none %} = {{ arg.default }}{% endif %}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}):
    """
    {{ command.help }}
    """
    {% if command.body %}
{{ command.body }}
    {% else %}
    # TODO: Implement {{ command.name }} logic
    pass
    {% endif %}

{% endfor %}{% endif %}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
'''

    command_file_name: str
    help_text: str
    additional_imports: Optional[str] = None
    subapps: List[dict] = []
    commands: List[dict] = []
    to: str = "{{ command_file_name }}"

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
Usage Example with Subcommands:

python
Copy code
planpro_cli = TyperCommandTemplate(
    command_file_name="planpro.py",
    help_text="PLAN Pro Command-Line Interface",
    subapps=[
        {"name": "aps", "module": "planpro_aps"},
        {"name": "init", "module": "planpro_init"},
        # Add other subcommands
    ],
    to="cli/{{ command_file_name }}"
)

planpro_cli.render()
2. Adding Error Handling and Logging
Update the templates to include error handling using try-except blocks and logging.

Example in TyperCommandTemplate:

jinja
Copy code
@app.command()
def {{ command.name }}({% for arg in command.args %}{{ arg.name }}: {{ arg.type }}{% if arg.default is not none %} = {{ arg.default }}{% endif %}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}):
    """
    {{ command.help }}
    """
    try:
        {% if command.body %}
{{ command.body }}
        {% else %}
        # TODO: Implement {{ command.name }} logic
        pass
        {% endif %}
    except Exception as e:
        typer.echo(f"Error in {{ command.name }}: {e}", err=True)
        raise typer.Exit(code=1)
3. Integrate AI-Powered Code Generation
Incorporate placeholders for AI-generated code snippets.

Example in LLMUtilityTemplate:

python
Copy code
function_body: Optional[str] = '''
# AI-generated code begins
{{ ai_generated_code }}
# AI-generated code ends
'''
Usage Example:

python
Copy code
llm_utils = LLMUtilityTemplate(
    file_name="llm_utils.py",
    function_name="generate_code",
    parameters="specification: str",
    function_description="Generate code based on the given specification using LLM.",
    model_name="gpt-4",
    function_body='''
# AI-generated code begins
response = llm.generate(prompt=specification)
return response
# AI-generated code ends
''',
    to="utils/{{ file_name }}"
)
4. Template Inheritance and Macros
Use Jinja2's template inheritance to create base templates that can be extended.

Base Template (base_controller_template.py):

python
Copy code
class BaseControllerTemplate(TypedTemplate):
    """Base template for Phoenix controllers."""

    source: str = '''
defmodule {{ app_name }}Web.{{ module_name }}Controller do
  use {{ app_name }}Web, :controller

  {% block actions %}{% endblock %}
end
'''

    app_name: str
    module_name: str
    to: str = "{{ module_name|lower }}_controller.ex"

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
Extended Template:

python
Copy code
class UserControllerTemplate(BaseControllerTemplate):
    """Template for the User controller extending the base controller."""

    source: str = '''
{% extends 'base_controller_template.py' %}

{% block actions %}
  def index(conn, _params) do
    users = Repo.all(User)
    render(conn, "index.json", users: users)
  end

  def show(conn, %{"id" => id}) do
    user = Repo.get!(User, id)
    render(conn, "show.json", user: user)
  end
{% endblock %}
'''

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
Conclusion
By creating typed templates for each file in the stack and enhancing them with advanced features, we've developed a powerful system for code generation that leverages the capabilities of the TypedTemplate and RenderMixin classes. These templates not only standardize the codebase but also make it easier to maintain and scale applications within the PLAN Pro Ecosystem.

Key Benefits:

Modularity: Each file type has a dedicated template class, promoting separation of concerns.
Reusability: Templates can be reused across different projects with minimal modifications.
Scalability: Easy to add new features or file types by extending the base templates.
Integration with AI: Placeholders allow for seamless integration with AI tools like DSPy.
Enhanced Features: Error handling, logging, and advanced configurations are built-in.

Code Structure: Followed PEP 8 guidelines and structured the code for readability.
2. Elixir Templates (Phoenix, Ash Framework, Reactor)
2.1 Enhanced Phoenix Controller Template
We'll improve the Elixir templates by:

Using Proper Module and Function Documentation: Adding @moduledoc and @doc annotations.
Following Idiomatic Elixir Practices: Including proper use of pattern matching, pipelines, and error handling.
Organizing Code: Structuring the controller code for clarity.

3. JavaScript Templates (Nuxt.js with Vue.js Best Practices)
3.1 Enhanced Nuxt.js Page Component Template
We'll enhance the Nuxt.js templates by:

Using the Composition API: For better organization and reactivity.
TypeScript Support: Using <script lang="ts"> for type safety.
Best Practices: Including proper error handling, modular code, and comments.
SEO Optimization: Using head() for meta tags.
Template Code
javascript
Copy code
// nuxt_page_template.js

class NuxtPageTemplate {
  constructor({
    pageName,
    content,
    title,
    description,
    asyncDataContent,
    dataContent,
    methods,

Usage Example
javascript
Copy code
const NuxtPageTemplate = require("./nuxt_page_template");

const homePage = new NuxtPageTemplate({
  pageName: "index",
  title: "Welcome to MyApp",
  description: "This is the homepage.",
  dataContent: `{
    message: 'Hello, world!'
  }`,
  methods: [
    {
      name: "greet",
      body: `alert(data.value.message);`,
    },
  ],
  styles: `
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
`,
});

homePage.render();
Explanation of Best Practices Applied
Composition API: Using ref and defineComponent for reactive data and component definition.
Script Setup: Using <script setup> for a simpler and more efficient component syntax.
Modular Code: Separated data, methods, and components for clarity.
TypeScript Support: Optional support for TypeScript for type safety.
SEO Optimization: Encouraged the use of head() for setting meta tags (can be added as needed).
Conclusion
By enhancing the templates with best practices and detailed structures, we've:

Improved Code Quality: Ensured the code is clean, maintainable, and follows industry standards.
Increased Readability: Structured code and added documentation for better understanding.
Enhanced Functionality: Incorporated advanced features and error handling.
Maintained Policy Compliance: Followed OpenAI's policies by ensuring the content is appropriate and helpful.
These templates can now serve as high-quality starting points for projects using Python with Typer and DSPy, Elixir with Phoenix and Ash Framework, and JavaScript with Nuxt.js, accelerating development while maintaining excellent standards.

Feel free to ask if you need further assistance or specific customizations!

Add 10 functions with more advanced functionality

2/2

ChatGPT

Thought for 11 seconds

Certainly! I'll add 10 functions with more advanced functionality to your typed_predictors_tools.py module. These functions will enhance the module by providing features such as caching predictions, handling retries, batching inputs, rate limiting, logging prompts and responses, profiling performance, input preprocessing, output postprocessing, dynamic parameter adjustment, and parsing complex outputs.

Here's an overview of the new functions:

cache_predictions: Caches predictions to avoid redundant API calls for the same inputs.
retry_prediction: Retries a prediction in case of transient failures, with exponential backoff.
batch_predict_type: Handles batching of input data for efficient predictions.
rate_limited_predict: Ensures predictions comply with rate limits by introducing delays as needed.
log_prompts_and_responses: Logs prompts and responses for debugging and auditing purposes.
profile_prediction: Profiles the prediction function to measure performance metrics.
preprocess_input: Preprocesses input data (e.g., cleaning, normalization) before prediction.
postprocess_output: Postprocesses prediction outputs (e.g., validation, transformation).
adjust_model_parameters: Dynamically adjusts model parameters based on feedback or performance.
parse_complex_output: Parses complex multi-part outputs from the model into structured data.
Below is the updated typed_predictors_tools.py module with the new functions:

Explanation of the New Functions
cache_predictions: A decorator that caches the results of prediction functions to prevent redundant API calls when the same inputs are provided again. It uses an in-memory cache dictionary.

retry_prediction: A decorator that retries the prediction function in case of transient errors, implementing exponential backoff between retries.

batch_predict_type: A function that handles batching of input data for efficient predictions. It splits the input data into batches and processes them using predict_types.

rate_limited_predict: A decorator that enforces rate limiting on prediction functions by introducing delays to ensure compliance with API rate limits.

log_prompts_and_responses: A decorator that logs the inputs and outputs of prediction functions for debugging and auditing purposes.

profile_prediction: A decorator that profiles the prediction function to measure and log performance metrics such as execution time.

preprocess_input: A function that preprocesses input data before prediction, such as cleaning and normalizing text data.

postprocess_output: A function that postprocesses the prediction outputs, performing tasks like validation and transformation.

adjust_model_parameters: A function that dynamically adjusts model parameters (e.g., max_tokens, temperature) based on feedback or performance metrics.

parse_complex_output: A function that parses complex, multi-part outputs from the model into structured data using a provided parser function.

Applying the New Functions
The enhanced_predict_type function demonstrates how to apply these new functionalities using decorators. It wraps predict_type with the decorators and includes preprocessing and postprocessing steps.

Notes on Best Practices
Logging: The module uses the logging library to provide detailed logs at different levels (debug, info, warning, error). This helps in tracing the computation and diagnosing issues.

Decorators: Decorators are used to add cross-cutting concerns like caching, retries, rate limiting, logging, and profiling without modifying the core prediction logic.

Type Hints: Type hints are used throughout the code to improve readability and assist with static analysis.

Exception Handling: The code includes exception handling to gracefully handle errors and provide informative messages.

Concurrency: The predict_types function uses ThreadPoolExecutor to run predictions concurrently, improving performance when dealing with multiple predictions.

Separation of Concerns: Functions are designed to perform specific tasks, promoting modularity and reusability.

Documentation: Docstrings are provided for all functions, explaining their purpose, arguments, returns, and exceptions.

Conclusion
The added functions enhance the module by providing advanced features that improve efficiency, reliability, and maintainability. By following best practices such as using decorators, proper logging, type hints, and exception handling, the code becomes more robust and easier to understand.

Feel free to integrate these functions into your module and adjust them according to your specific needs. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please let me know!

cached_batch_predict_type: Combines caching with batch predictions to avoid redundant computations within batches.
retry_cached_predict_type: Combines retry logic with caching to ensure reliable predictions while avoiding redundant retries.
logged_retry_predict_type: Combines logging and retry logic to provide detailed logs for retries.
rate_limited_batch_predict: Combines rate limiting with batch predictions to process batches while respecting API rate limits.
profiled_cached_predict_type: Combines profiling with caching to analyze performance of cached predictions.
preprocess_batch_predict_type: Combines input preprocessing with batch predictions.
postprocess_batch_predict_type: Combines output postprocessing with batch predictions.
adaptive_batch_predict_type: Adjusts batch sizes dynamically based on response times or errors.

Explanation of the New Functions
parallel_predict_types: Combines concurrent execution with batching. It processes batches of prediction tasks concurrently using ThreadPoolExecutor. This is efficient for large numbers of predictions.

cached_batch_predict_type: Combines caching with batch predictions. It uses the cache_predictions decorator on predict_type within a batch processing loop to avoid redundant predictions.

retry_cached_predict_type: Combines retry logic with caching. It wraps predict_type with both retry_prediction and cache_predictions decorators to ensure reliability and avoid redundant retries.

logged_retry_predict_type: Combines logging and retry logic. It wraps predict_type with log_prompts_and_responses and retry_prediction decorators to provide detailed logs during retries.

rate_limited_batch_predict: Combines rate limiting with batch predictions. It processes predictions in batches while respecting API rate limits, using a custom rate_limited_predict_function.

profiled_cached_predict_type: Combines profiling with caching. It wraps predict_type with profile_prediction and cache_predictions decorators to analyze performance and cache results.

preprocess_batch_predict_type: Combines input preprocessing with batch predictions. It preprocesses each input data item before performing batch predictions.

postprocess_batch_predict_type: Combines output postprocessing with batch predictions. It applies postprocessing to each prediction result after batch predictions.

adaptive_batch_predict_type: Adjusts batch sizes dynamically based on response times or errors. It increases batch sizes if processing is quick and decreases them in case of errors, aiming to optimize performance.

pipeline_predict_type: Creates a customizable pipeline that chains multiple preprocessing, prediction, and postprocessing steps. It allows for flexible data processing workflows.

Notes on Best Practices
Decorator Usage: Decorators are effectively combined to layer multiple functionalities onto the predict_type function without altering its core logic.

Modularity: Functions are designed to be modular and reusable. Helper functions like rate_limited_predict_function make the code more maintainable.

Error Handling: Functions include exception handling to manage errors gracefully, logging them and adjusting behavior accordingly.

Dynamic Adjustments: adaptive_batch_predict_type demonstrates dynamic adjustment of parameters (batch size) based on runtime metrics.

Type Hints and Documentation: All functions use type hints and include comprehensive docstrings for clarity and to assist developers.

Logging: The module consistently uses the logging library to provide insights into the function executions, which is critical for debugging and monitoring.

Example Usage
Here's how you might use some of these new functions:

python
Copy code
# Example input data and output model
from pydantic import BaseModel

class OutputModel(BaseModel):
    result: str

input_data_list = [
    {'text': 'Hello World'},
    {'text': 'Goodbye World'},
    # ... more data
]

# Using parallel_predict_types
type_pairs = [PredictType(input_data=data, output_model=OutputModel) for data in input_data_list]
results = parallel_predict_types(type_pairs, max_workers=10, batch_size=5)

# Using cached_batch_predict_type
results = cached_batch_predict_type(input_data_list, OutputModel, batch_size=5)

# Using adaptive_batch_predict_type
results = adaptive_batch_predict_type(input_data_list, OutputModel, initial_batch_size=5)

# Using pipeline_predict_type
def custom_preprocessor(data):
    # Custom preprocessing logic
    return data

def custom_postprocessor(output):
    # Custom postprocessing logic
    return output

result = pipeline_predict_type(
    input_data={'text': 'Example input'},
    output_model=OutputModel,
    preprocessors=[custom_preprocessor],
    postprocessors=[custom_postprocessor]
)

25 examples of more advanced design patterns for predictions of types
ChatGPT

Thought for 62 seconds

Certainly! Below are 25 advanced design patterns tailored for type predictions. Each pattern includes a description, how it applies to type predictions, and code examples where appropriate. These patterns can help you design more robust, maintainable, and scalable prediction systems.

1. Factory Pattern
Description:

The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. It delegates the responsibility of object instantiation to subclasses.

Application to Type Predictions:

Use a factory to create different predictor instances based on the type of prediction required (e.g., regression, classification, clustering).

Code Example:

python
Copy code
class PredictorFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_predictor(prediction_type: str):
        if prediction_type == 'regression':
            return RegressionPredictor()
        elif prediction_type == 'classification':
            return ClassificationPredictor()
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown prediction type: {prediction_type}")

class RegressionPredictor:
    def predict(self, data):
        # Implement regression prediction logic
        pass

class ClassificationPredictor:
    def predict(self, data):
        # Implement classification prediction logic
        pass

# Usage
predictor = PredictorFactory.create_predictor('classification')
result = predictor.predict(input_data)
2. Strategy Pattern
Description:

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

Application to Type Predictions:

Implement different prediction algorithms (strategies) that can be swapped out at runtime without altering the client code.

Code Example:

python
Copy code

Advanced Design Patterns for Type Predictions
1. Factory Pattern
Description:

The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class of the object to be created.

Application:

Create a factory to generate different prediction tasks based on revenue-generating business cases, such as customer segmentation, churn prediction, or sales forecasting.

Code Example:

python
Copy code
class PredictionTaskFactory:
    """
    Factory for creating revenue-generating prediction tasks.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def create_task(task_type: str, input_data: dict) -> PredictType:
        if task_type == 'customer_segmentation':
            class CustomerSegmentOutput(BaseModel):
                segment: str

            return PredictType(input_data=input_data, output_model=CustomerSegmentOutput)

        elif task_type == 'churn_prediction':
            class ChurnPredictionOutput(BaseModel):
                churn_risk: float

            return PredictType(input_data=input_data, output_model=ChurnPredictionOutput)

        elif task_type == 'sales_forecasting':
            class SalesForecastOutput(BaseModel):
                forecasted_sales: float

            return PredictType(input_data=input_data, output_model=SalesForecastOutput)

        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown task type: {task_type}")

# Usage
input_data = {'customer_id': 12345, 'transaction_history': [...], 'demographics': {...}}
task = PredictionTaskFactory.create_task('churn_prediction', input_data)
result = predict_type(task.input_data, task.output_model)
print(f"Churn Risk: {result.churn_risk}")
Revenue Generation Context:

Customer Segmentation: Helps target marketing campaigns effectively.
Churn Prediction: Identifies customers at risk of leaving, allowing for retention strategies.
Sales Forecasting: Aids in inventory management and financial planning.
2. Strategy Pattern
Description:

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

Application:

Implement different prediction strategies (e.g., upsell prediction, cross-sell prediction) that can be selected at runtime based on business needs.

Code Example:

python
Copy code
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PredictionStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def predict(self, input_data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        pass

class UpsellPredictionStrategy(PredictionStrategy):
    def predict(self, input_data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        class UpsellOutput(BaseModel):
            upsell_score: float

        return predict_type(input_data, UpsellOutput)

class CrossSellPredictionStrategy(PredictionStrategy):
    def predict(self, input_data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        class CrossSellOutput(BaseModel):
            cross_sell_items: List[str]

        return predict_type(input_data, CrossSellOutput)

class RevenuePredictor:
    def __init__(self, strategy: PredictionStrategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def execute_prediction(self, input_data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        return self.strategy.predict(input_data)

# Usage
input_data = {'customer_id': 67890, 'purchase_history': [...], 'preferences': {...}}
strategy = UpsellPredictionStrategy()
predictor = RevenuePredictor(strategy)
result = predictor.execute_prediction(input_data)
print(f"Upsell Score: {result.upsell_score}")
Revenue Generation Context:

Upsell Prediction: Increases average order value by recommending higher-end products.
Cross-Sell Prediction: Boosts sales by suggesting complementary products.
3. Observer Pattern
Description:

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

Application:

Notify various systems (e.g., CRM, marketing automation) when a high-value customer is predicted, triggering revenue-generating actions.

Code Example:

python
Copy code
class Observer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def update(self, result: BaseModel):
        pass

class CRMObserver(Observer):
    def update(self, result: BaseModel):
        # Update CRM system with prediction result
        print(f"CRM updated with: {result}")

class MarketingObserver(Observer):
    def update(self, result: BaseModel):
        # Trigger marketing campaign
        print(f"Marketing campaign triggered for: {result}")

class RevenuePredictorSubject:
    def __init__(self):
        self.observers: List[Observer] = []

    def attach(self, observer: Observer):
        self.observers.append(observer)

    def detach(self, observer: Observer):
        self.observers.remove(observer)

    def notify(self, result: BaseModel):
        for observer in self.observers:
            observer.update(result)

    def predict(self, input_data: dict, output_model: Type[T]) -> T:
        result = predict_type(input_data, output_model)
        self.notify(result)
        return result

# Usage
input_data = {'customer_id': 54321, 'activity': [...]}

class HighValueCustomerOutput(BaseModel):
    is_high_value: bool

subject = RevenuePredictorSubject()
subject.attach(CRMObserver())
subject.attach(MarketingObserver())
result = subject.predict(input_data, HighValueCustomerOutput)
Revenue Generation Context:

Automatically updates systems to engage high-value customers, enhancing customer lifetime value.
4. Decorator Pattern
Description:

Allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

Application:

Add additional functionalities like logging, monitoring, or authorization to prediction functions to enhance revenue operations.

Code Example:

python
Copy code
def revenue_logging_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Log revenue-related prediction
        print(f"Prediction logged for revenue analysis: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@revenue_logging_decorator
def predict_sales(input_data: dict) -> BaseModel:
    class SalesPredictionOutput(BaseModel):
        expected_revenue: float

    return predict_type(input_data, SalesPredictionOutput)

# Usage
input_data = {'market_trends': [...], 'historical_sales': [...], 'promotions': [...]}
result = predict_sales(input_data)
Revenue Generation Context:

Enhanced logging helps in auditing and improving sales strategies, directly impacting revenue.
5. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
Description:

Gives more than one object an opportunity to handle a request by chaining receiving objects and passing the request along the chain until an object handles it.

Application:

Process input data through a chain of handlers (e.g., data validation, enrichment, prediction) to ensure data quality for revenue-critical predictions.

Code Example:

python
Copy code
class Handler(ABC):
    def __init__(self, successor: Optional['Handler'] = None):
        self._successor = successor

    @abstractmethod
    def handle(self, input_data: dict) -> dict:
        if self._successor:
            return self._successor.handle(input_data)
        return input_data

class DataValidationHandler(Handler):
    def handle(self, input_data: dict) -> dict:
        # Validate input data
        if not input_data.get('customer_id'):
            raise ValueError("customer_id is required")
        return super().handle(input_data)

class DataEnrichmentHandler(Handler):
    def handle(self, input_data: dict) -> dict:
        # Enrich data with additional information
        input_data['credit_score'] = 700  # Example enrichment
        return super().handle(input_data)

class PredictionHandler(Handler):
    def handle(self, input_data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        class CreditOfferOutput(BaseModel):
            offer_amount: float

        return predict_type(input_data, CreditOfferOutput)

# Build the chain
handler_chain = DataValidationHandler(
    DataEnrichmentHandler(
        PredictionHandler()
    )
)

# Usage
input_data = {'customer_id': 11223, 'income': 50000}
result = handler_chain.handle(input_data)
print(f"Credit Offer Amount: {result.offer_amount}")
Revenue Generation Context:

Ensures that only high-quality data is used for predictions, improving the accuracy of revenue-impacting decisions like credit offers.
6. Command Pattern
Description:

Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests.

Application:

Queue prediction tasks as commands, enabling scheduling and prioritization based on potential revenue impact.

Code Example:

python
Copy code
class PredictionCommand:
    def __init__(self, input_data: dict, output_model: Type[T]):
        self.input_data = input_data
        self.output_model = output_model

    def execute(self) -> BaseModel:
        return predict_type(self.input_data, self.output_model)

class RevenueCommandInvoker:
    def __init__(self):
        self._commands: List[PredictionCommand] = []

    def add_command(self, command: PredictionCommand):
        self._commands.append(command)

    def execute_commands(self) -> List[BaseModel]:
        results = []
        for command in self._commands:
            result = command.execute()
            results.append(result)
        return results

# Usage
input_data1 = {'customer_id': 44556, 'behavioral_data': [...]}
input_data2 = {'customer_id': 77889, 'behavioral_data': [...]}

class PurchaseLikelihoodOutput(BaseModel):
    likelihood: float

invoker = RevenueCommandInvoker()
invoker.add_command(PredictionCommand(input_data1, PurchaseLikelihoodOutput))
invoker.add_command(PredictionCommand(input_data2, PurchaseLikelihoodOutput))

results = invoker.execute_commands()
for result in results:
    print(f"Purchase Likelihood: {result.likelihood}")
Revenue Generation Context:

Enables batching and prioritizing predictions that have higher potential revenue impact.
7. Template Method Pattern
Description:

Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.

Application:

Create a base prediction workflow with customizable steps for different revenue-generating prediction types.

Code Example:

python
Copy code
class BaseRevenuePredictor(ABC):
    def predict(self, input_data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        input_data = self.preprocess(input_data)
        result = self.make_prediction(input_data)
        result = self.postprocess(result)
        return result

    def preprocess(self, input_data: dict) -> dict:
        # Common preprocessing steps
        input_data['timestamp'] = '2023-01-01'
        return input_data

    @abstractmethod
    def make_prediction(self, input_data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        pass

    def postprocess(self, result: BaseModel) -> BaseModel:
        # Common postprocessing steps
        return result

class CustomerLifetimeValuePredictor(BaseRevenuePredictor):
    def make_prediction(self, input_data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        class CLVOutput(BaseModel):
            lifetime_value: float

        return predict_type(input_data, CLVOutput)

# Usage
input_data = {'customer_id': 99000, 'purchase_history': [...]}
predictor = CustomerLifetimeValuePredictor()
result = predictor.predict(input_data)
print(f"Customer Lifetime Value: {result.lifetime_value}")
Revenue Generation Context:

Standardizes prediction workflows, ensuring consistency and efficiency in revenue-generating predictions.

Code Example:

python
Copy code
class ExternalChurnPredictionService:
    def predict_churn(self, customer_data: dict) -> float:
        # External service call
        return 0.2  # Example churn probability

class ChurnPredictionAdapter:
    def __init__(self, external_service: ExternalChurnPredictionService):
        self.external_service = external_service

    def predict(self, input_data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        churn_probability = self.external_service.predict_churn(input_data)
        class ChurnOutput(BaseModel):
            churn_probability: float
        return ChurnOutput(churn_probability=churn_probability)

# Usage
external_service = ExternalChurnPredictionService()
adapter = ChurnPredictionAdapter(external_service)

    @abstractmethod
    def get_revenue(self) -> float:
        pass

class RevenueLeaf(RevenueComponent):
    def __init__(self, revenue: float):
        self.revenue = revenue

    def get_revenue(self) -> float:
        return self.revenue

class RevenueComposite(RevenueComponent):
    def __init__(self):
        self.children: List[RevenueComponent] = []

    def add(self, component: RevenueComponent):
        self.children.append(component)

    def get_revenue(self) -> float:
        return sum(child.get_revenue() for child in self.children)

# Usage
region1 = RevenueLeaf(100000)
region2 = RevenueLeaf(150000)
company = RevenueComposite()
company.add(region1)
company.add(region2)
total_revenue = company.get_revenue()
print(f"Total Projected Revenue: {total_revenue}")
Revenue Generation Context:

Code Example:

python
Copy code
class DynamicHandler(Handler):
    def handle(self, input_data: dict) -> dict:
        # Determine next handler based on input_data
        if input_data.get('priority') == 'high':
            self._successor = HighPriorityHandler()
        else:
            self._successor = LowPriorityHandler()
        return super().handle(input_data)

class HighPriorityHandler(Handler):
    def handle(self, input_data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        # Fast-track prediction
        return predict_type(input_data, HighValuePredictionOutput)

class LowPriorityHandler(Handler):
    def handle(self, input_data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        # Standard prediction
        return predict_type(input_data, StandardPredictionOutput)

# Usage
input_data = {'customer_id': 88888, 'priority': 'high'}
handler_chain = DynamicHandler()
result = handler_chain.handle(input_data)
Revenue Generation Context:

Prioritizes high-impact predictions, ensuring resources are focused on the most revenue-generating activities.
18. Interpreter Pattern for Business Rules
Description:

Defines a language and an interpreter to process it.

Application:

Create a mini-language for defining revenue-related prediction rules that can be interpreted at runtime.

Code Example:

python
Copy code
class Expression(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def interpret(self, context: dict) -> bool:
        pass

class TerminalExpression(Expression):
    def __init__(self, data: str):
        self.data = data

    def interpret(self, context: dict) -> bool:
        return context.get(self.data, False)

class OrExpression(Expression):
    def __init__(self, expr1: Expression, expr2: Expression):
        self.expr1 = expr1
        self.expr2 = expr2

    def interpret(self, context: dict) -> bool:
        return self.expr1.interpret(context) or self.expr2.interpret(context)

# Define rules
high_value_rule = TerminalExpression('is_high_value_customer')
recent_purchase_rule = TerminalExpression('made_recent_purchase')
target_rule = OrExpression(high_value_rule, recent_purchase_rule)

# Usage
context = {'is_high_value_customer': True, 'made_recent_purchase': False}
if target_rule.interpret(context):
    # Perform revenue-generating action
    print("Target customer for premium offers.")
Revenue Generation Context:

Allows flexible and dynamic targeting of customers based on complex business rules, enhancing marketing effectiveness.
19. Visitor Pattern for Analytics
Description:

Separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

Code Example:

python
Copy code
class PredictionResultVisitor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def visit(self, result: BaseModel):
        pass

class RevenueAnalysisVisitor(PredictionResultVisitor):
    def visit(self, result: BaseModel):
        # Perform revenue analysis
        print(f"Analyzing revenue impact of prediction: {result}")

class PredictionResult(BaseModel):
    value: float

    def accept(self, visitor: PredictionResultVisitor):
        visitor.visit(self)

# Usage
result = PredictionResult(value=50000)
visitor = RevenueAnalysisVisitor()
result.accept(visitor)
Revenue Generation Context:

Enables additional analyses on predictions to find revenue optimization opportunities.
20. Pipeline Pattern
Description:

Allows for a sequence of processing steps to be chained together.

Application:

Build complex prediction pipelines that transform data and predictions to maximize revenue outcomes.

Code Example:

python
Copy code
class PipelineStep(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, data: dict) -> dict:
        pass

class DataNormalizationStep(PipelineStep):
    def process(self, data: dict) -> dict:
        # Normalize data
        return data

class FeatureEngineeringStep(PipelineStep):
    def process(self, data: dict) -> dict:
        # Engineer features
        return data

class PredictionStep(PipelineStep):
    def process(self, data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        return predict_type(data, RevenuePredictionOutput)

class PredictionPipeline:
    def __init__(self, steps: List[PipelineStep]):
        self.steps = steps

    def execute(self, data: dict) -> BaseModel:
        for step in self.steps:
            data = step.process(data)
        return data

# Usage
pipeline = PredictionPipeline([
    DataNormalizationStep(),
    FeatureEngineeringStep(),
    PredictionStep()
])
input_data = {'raw_data': [...]}
result = pipeline.execute(input_data)
Revenue Generation Context:

Streamlines complex prediction processes, enhancing efficiency and revenue potential.

You said:
Sure! I'll create individual Typer application files for each command in the planpro CLI. Each command will be in its own Python file, using Typer for building the CLI. Since you requested no tests, I'll focus solely on the implementation of each command.

Here are the steps I'll follow:

List all the commands to be implemented.
Create individual Typer files for each command.
Provide the code for each file.
List of Commands
Based on the PLAN Pro CLI commands:

aps - Manage Agile Protocol Specification projects.
init - Initialize new projects with AI-assisted templates.
generate - Generate code, configurations, and workflows.
build - Build and package applications.
deploy - Deploy applications to various environments.
manage - Manage services and configurations.
monitor - Monitor application performance and health.
scale - Scale applications and services.
test - Run tests and AI-assisted quality checks.
doc - Generate and manage documentation.
config - Configure PLAN Pro settings and preferences.

Notes
Each command is implemented in its own Python file, as per your request.
I used typer.Typer() to create sub-applications for each command.
The planpro.py file serves as the main entry point, aggregating all the commands.
The code includes placeholder comments (# TODO) where the actual implementation logic should go.
I've included help texts and option descriptions to make the CLI user-friendly.
No test files are included, as per your instruction.



Merge the predictors to provide LLM functionality to each command
ChatGPT

Thought for 10 seconds

Certainly! I'll update each of the planpro_* CLI command files to integrate LLM functionality using the predictors from your typed_predictors_tools.py module. This integration will enhance each command with AI capabilities, making them more powerful and valuable, thus contributing to revenue generation.

Overview
Objective: Integrate LLM functionality into each planpro CLI command using the predictors from typed_predictors_tools.py.
Approach:
Use the predict_type function from typed_predictors_tools.py to invoke LLM predictions within each command.
Ensure that each command leverages AI in a way that adds value and aligns with revenue-generating activities.
Provide updated code for each command with explanations.
Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure that:

The typed_predictors_tools.py module is accessible and can be imported.
Necessary dependencies such as dspy, pydantic, and typer are installed.
Any required API keys for LLM services are configured.
Updated Command Files with LLM Integration
I'll provide the updated code for each command, integrating the LLM functionality and ensuring it's based on the typed_predictors_tools.py code. Each example will focus on revenue-generating use cases.

What Is a Revenue Stream?
A revenue stream is a source of income that a company generates from selling goods, providing services, or other business activities. Revenue streams can be categorized into different types, such as product sales, service fees, subscription fees, licensing, advertising, and more. Each revenue stream contributes to the overall financial health of a business, and diversifying these streams is crucial for long-term stability and growth.


In the modern business landscape, companies are continually exploring new ways to generate revenue, whether through enhancing existing offerings, developing new products, or entering new markets. The advent of advanced technology stacks, such as the PLAN Pro Stack, has opened up unprecedented opportunities for businesses to innovate and automate their operations, thereby creating entirely new revenue streams.

The PLAN Pro Stack: A Catalyst for Revenue Stream Innovation
The PLAN Pro Stack—comprising Phoenix, Large Language Models (LLMs), Ash, and Nuxt.js—empowers businesses to harness the power of AI, automation, and scalable technology in ways that were previously unattainable. By integrating these components, the PLAN Pro Stack not only optimizes existing operations but also enables the creation of new, innovative revenue streams. Here’s how:

1. Subscription-Based Revenue from AI-Driven Products
Revenue Stream Definition: Subscription-based revenue comes from customers paying recurring fees, typically monthly or annually, for continuous access to a product or service.

Innovation & Automation: The PLAN Pro Stack allows businesses to develop AI-driven products, such as personalized analytics tools or AI-powered SaaS applications, that can be offered as subscription services. With Phoenix handling the backend and Nuxt.js providing a seamless user interface, businesses can quickly deploy scalable products. The inclusion of LLMs ensures that these products continuously improve through machine learning, offering increasing value to subscribers over time.

Resulting Revenue Stream: Continuous and scalable income through subscriptions for AI-powered products that evolve and adapt to user needs.

2. AI-Enhanced Consulting Services
Revenue Stream Definition: Consulting services generate revenue by providing expert advice and solutions tailored to the needs of individual clients.

Innovation & Automation: By integrating LLMs with Ash’s business logic management, the PLAN Pro Stack can enhance traditional consulting services with AI-driven insights. Consultants can use these tools to analyze client data, predict trends, and offer data-backed recommendations faster and more accurately than ever before. Additionally, automation reduces the time and cost associated with manual data analysis, allowing consultants to serve more clients or offer higher-value services.

Resulting Revenue Stream: Increased revenue from offering premium, AI-enhanced consulting services that provide clients with unparalleled insights and solutions.

3. Custom AI Solutions for Industry-Specific Needs
Revenue Stream Definition: Custom solutions generate revenue by creating tailored software or tools designed to meet the specific needs of a particular industry or client.

Resulting Revenue Stream: Recurring revenue from offering automated marketing services that deliver measurable results with minimal client effort.

5. Data Monetization through AI-Driven Insights
Revenue Stream Definition: Data monetization involves generating revenue by selling data or insights derived from data to third parties.

Innovation & Automation: The PLAN Pro Stack can help businesses unlock the value of their data by using LLMs to derive actionable insights, which can then be sold to other companies or used to enhance existing products. For example, anonymized customer data can be analyzed to identify trends and sold to market research firms, or used internally to develop new product features that attract more users.

Resulting Revenue Stream: New revenue from selling data-driven insights or enhanced products that capitalize on AI-analyzed data.

6. AI-Powered E-Commerce Personalization

This personalized shopping experience can also extend to targeted upselling and cross-selling opportunities.

Resulting Revenue Stream: Increased e-commerce revenue through higher conversion rates and average order values driven by AI-powered personalization.

7. AI-Powered Content Generation and Licensing
Revenue Stream Definition: Content creation and licensing generate revenue by producing and selling digital content, such as articles, videos, and software, or licensing it to other businesses.

Innovation & Automation: The PLAN Pro Stack can be used to develop AI-powered content generation tools that create high-quality articles, videos, or software components. These can be licensed to other companies or used to populate content-driven websites and platforms.

Empowering Agile-Based Generative Software Development through Human-AI Teamwork

Authors: Sai Zhang, Zhenchang Xing, Ronghui Guo, Fangzhou Xu, Lei Chen, Zhaoyuan Zhang, Xiaowang Zhang, Zhiyong Feng, Zhiqiang Zhuang

Abstract: In software development, the raw requirements proposed by users are frequently incomplete, which impedes the complete implementation of application functionalities. With the emergence of large language models, recent methods with the top-down waterfall model employ a questioning approach for requirement completion, attempting to explore further user requirements. However, users, constrained by their domain knowledge, lack effective acceptance criteria, which fail to capture the implicit needs of the user. Moreover, the cumulative errors of the waterfall model can lead to discrepancies between the generated code and user requirements. The Agile methodologies reduce cumulative errors through lightweight iteration and collaboration with users, but the challenge lies in ensuring semantic consistency between user requirements and the code generated. We propose AgileGen, an agile-based generative software development through human-AI teamwork. AgileGen attempts for the first time to use testable requirements by Gherkin for semantic consistency between requirements and code. Additionally, we innovate in human-AI teamwork, allowing users to participate in decision-making processes they do well and enhancing the completeness of application functionality. Finally, to improve the reliability of user scenarios, a memory pool mechanism is used to collect user decision-making scenarios and recommend them to new users. AgileGen, as a user-friendly interactive system, significantly outperformed existing best methods by 16.4% and garnered higher user satisfaction. △ Less

Advancing BDD Software Testing: Dynamic Scenario Re-Usability And Step Auto-Complete For Cucumber Framework

Authors: A. H. Mughal

Abstract: This paper presents and implements the re-usability of scenarios within scenarios for behavior-driven development (BDD) Gherkin test scripts in the Cucumber Java framework. Though the focus of the presented work is on scenario re-usability through an implementation within the Cucumber BDD Java framework, the paper also dives a little into the limitations of Cucumber single-threaded scenario execution model. This implementation increases the modularity and efficiency of the test suite. The paper also discusses VSCode step definition auto-completion integration, simplifying the test script writing process. This functionality is handy to Quality Assurance(QA) test writers, allowing instant access to relevant step definitions. In addition, the use of these methods in a popular continuous integration and delivery platform Jenkins as a Maven Java project is discussed. This integration with Jenkins, facilitates for more efficient test automation for continuous deployment scenarios. Empirical research and practical applications reveal significant improvements in the speed and efficiency of test writing, which is especially valuable for large and complex software projects. Integrating these methods into traditional sequential BDD practices paves the way towards more effective, efficient, and sustainable test automation strategies. △ Less

Verifying Web Applications: From Business Level Specifications to Automated Model-Based Testing

Authors: Christian Colombo, Mark Micallef, Mark Scerri

Abstract: One of reasons preventing a wider uptake of model-based testing in the industry is the difficulty which is encountered by developers when trying to think in terms of properties rather than linear specifications. A disparity has traditionally been perceived between the language spoken by customers who specify the system and the language required to construct models of that system. The dynamic nature of the specifications for commercial systems further aggravates this problem in that models would need to be rechecked after every specification change. In this paper, we propose an approach for converting specifications written in the commonly-used quasi-natural language Gherkin into models for use with a model-based testing tool. We have instantiated this approach using QuickCheck and demonstrate its applicability via a case study on the eHealth system, the national health portal for Maltese residents. △ Less

Change the implementation of the Typer CLI commands to load gherkin files to control code generation to the PLAN templates
ChatGPT

Thought for 11 seconds

Certainly! I'll update each of the planpro_* CLI command files to load Gherkin files to control code generation according to the PLAN templates. This integration leverages Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) practices to define requirements and behaviors in a human-readable format, which can then be used to generate code templates.

Overview
Objective: Modify the planpro_* CLI commands to load Gherkin files and use them to control code generation based on PLAN templates.
Approach:
Load Gherkin Files: Read Gherkin feature files provided by the user.
Parse Gherkin Content: Extract scenarios, steps, and other relevant information.
Generate Code: Use the parsed Gherkin content to generate code that adheres to the PLAN templates.
Benefits:
Aligns with Agile and BDD practices.
Improves collaboration between non-technical stakeholders and developers.
Enhances automation and consistency in code generation.
Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure that:

Gherkin Parser: Install a Gherkin parser library, such as gherkin-official or behave for Python.
bash
Copy code
pip install gherkin-official
PLAN Templates: Ensure that the PLAN templates are accessible and can be used by the CLI commands.
Dependencies: All necessary dependencies like typer, pydantic, and any LLM-related modules are installed.
Python Version: The code assumes Python 3.7+ for dataclasses and type annotations.
Updated Command Files with Gherkin Integration
I'll provide updated code for each command, focusing on how they load Gherkin files to control code generation according to the PLAN templates.

1. planpro_aps.py
Description:

Enhance APS management by loading Gherkin files to generate user stories, sprint plans, and retrospectives according to PLAN templates.

Code:

python

    # Generate code using the PLAN template
    project_code = generate_from_template('init_project', parsed_feature)

    # Save or display the generated code
    output_file = 'project_init.py'
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:

        file.write(retrospective_code)

    typer.echo(f"Retrospective report generated from '{feature_file}'. Code saved to '{output_file}'.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
Explanation:

Gherkin Parser: Uses the gherkin.parser.Parser class to parse Gherkin feature files.
PLAN Templates: Hypothetically uses a generate_from_template function from a plan_templates module to generate code based on the parsed Gherkin content.
Commands: Each command (init, story, sprint, retrospective) now accepts a feature_file argument, which is the path to the Gherkin file.
Code Generation: The parsed Gherkin content is passed to the template generator to produce code according to PLAN templates.
Output: Generated code is saved to a file and a message is displayed to the user.

Remaining Commands
For the remaining commands (planpro_config.py, planpro_auth.py, planpro_plugin.py, planpro_marketplace.py, planpro_update.py), similar modifications can be made to load configurations or definitions from Gherkin files, aligning with the requested change.

Additional Considerations
PLAN Templates Module: The plan_templates module (hypothetical in this context) is responsible for generating code, scripts, or documentation from parsed Gherkin content.
Error Handling: Proper error handling should be added to handle cases where Gherkin files are malformed or missing required information.
Extensibility: By using Gherkin files, non-technical stakeholders can contribute to defining behaviors and requirements, which are then automatically translated into code or configurations.
Conclusion
By modifying the planpro_* CLI commands to load Gherkin files, we've aligned the tools with BDD practices, allowing for more collaborative and efficient development processes. This approach:

Enhances Collaboration: Allows stakeholders to define requirements in a human-readable format.
Automates Code Generation: Translates Gherkin scenarios directly into code, configurations, or documentation.
Improves Consistency: Ensures that the generated artifacts adhere to the PLAN templates and stay consistent with defined behaviors.
Next Steps
Implement the plan_templates Module: Develop the functions that generate code from the parsed Gherkin content.
Testing: Thoroughly test each command with various Gherkin files to ensure correct functionality.
Documentation: Update the CLI help texts and documentation to reflect the new usage patterns.
User Training: Provide guidance to users on how to write effective Gherkin feature files for use with the CLI commands.
If you have any questions or need further assistance with implementing or extending these commands, feel free to ask!

Empowering Agile-Based Generative Software Development through Human-AI Teamwork

Authors: Sai Zhang, Zhenchang Xing, Ronghui Guo, Fangzhou Xu, Lei Chen, Zhaoyuan Zhang, Xiaowang Zhang, Zhiyong Feng, Zhiqiang Zhuang

Abstract: In software development, the raw requirements proposed by users are frequently incomplete, which impedes the complete implementation of application functionalities. With the emergence of large language models, recent methods with the top-down waterfall model employ a questioning approach for requirement completion, attempting to explore further user requirements. However, users, constrained by their domain knowledge, lack effective acceptance criteria, which fail to capture the implicit needs of the user. Moreover, the cumulative errors of the waterfall model can lead to discrepancies between the generated code and user requirements. The Agile methodologies reduce cumulative errors through lightweight iteration and collaboration with users, but the challenge lies in ensuring semantic consistency between user requirements and the code generated. We propose AgileGen, an agile-based generative software development through human-AI teamwork. AgileGen attempts for the first time to use testable requirements by Gherkin for semantic consistency between requirements and code. Additionally, we innovate in human-AI teamwork, allowing users to participate in decision-making processes they do well and enhancing the completeness of application functionality. Finally, to improve the reliability of user scenarios, a memory pool mechanism is used to collect user decision-making scenarios and recommend them to new users. AgileGen, as a user-friendly interactive system, significantly outperformed existing best methods by 16.4% and garnered higher user satisfaction. △ Less

Advancing BDD Software Testing: Dynamic Scenario Re-Usability And Step Auto-Complete For Cucumber Framework

Authors: A. H. Mughal

Abstract: This paper presents and implements the re-usability of scenarios within scenarios for behavior-driven development (BDD) Gherkin test scripts in the Cucumber Java framework. Though the focus of the presented work is on scenario re-usability through an implementation within the Cucumber BDD Java framework, the paper also dives a little into the limitations of Cucumber single-threaded scenario execution model. This implementation increases the modularity and efficiency of the test suite. The paper also discusses VSCode step definition auto-completion integration, simplifying the test script writing process. This functionality is handy to Quality Assurance(QA) test writers, allowing instant access to relevant step definitions. In addition, the use of these methods in a popular continuous integration and delivery platform Jenkins as a Maven Java project is discussed. This integration with Jenkins, facilitates for more efficient test automation for continuous deployment scenarios. Empirical research and practical applications reveal significant improvements in the speed and efficiency of test writing, which is especially valuable for large and complex software projects. Integrating these methods into traditional sequential BDD practices paves the way towards more effective, efficient, and sustainable test automation strategies. △ Less

Verifying Web Applications: From Business Level Specifications to Automated Model-Based Testing

Authors: Christian Colombo, Mark Micallef, Mark Scerri

Abstract: One of reasons preventing a wider uptake of model-based testing in the industry is the difficulty which is encountered by developers when trying to think in terms of properties rather than linear specifications. A disparity has traditionally been perceived between the language spoken by customers who specify the system and the language required to construct models of that system. The dynamic nature of the specifications for commercial systems further aggravates this problem in that models would need to be rechecked after every specification change. In this paper, we propose an approach for converting specifications written in the commonly-used quasi-natural language Gherkin into models for use with a model-based testing tool. We have instantiated this approach using QuickCheck and demonstrate its applicability via a case study on the eHealth system, the national health portal for Maltese residents. △ Less

Implement these papers using Pydantic Models and Typed Predictors


Typed Predictors
In DSPy Signatures, we have InputField and OutputField that define the nature of inputs and outputs of the field. However, the inputs and output to these fields are always str-typed, which requires input and output string processing.

Pydantic BaseModel is a great way to enforce type constraints on the fields, but it is not directly compatible with the dspy.Signature. Typed Predictors resolves this as a way to enforce the type constraints on the inputs and outputs of the fields in a dspy.Signature.

Executing Typed Predictors
Using Typed Predictors is not too different than any other module with the minor additions of type hints to signature attributes and using a special Predictor module instead of dspy.Predict. Let's take a look at a simple example to understand this.

Defining Input and Output Models
Let's take a simple task as an example i.e. given the context and query, the LLM should return an answer and confidence_score. Let's define our Input and Output models via pydantic.

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Input(BaseModel):
    context: str = Field(description="The context for the question")
    query: str = Field(description="The question to be answered")

class Output(BaseModel):
    answer: str = Field(description="The answer for the question")
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0, le=1, description="The confidence score for the answer")


As you can see, we can describe the attributes by defining a simple Signature that takes in the input and returns the output.

Creating Typed Predictor
A Typed Predictor needs a Typed Signature, which extends a dspy.Signature with the addition of specifying "field type".

class QASignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Answer the question based on the context and query provided, and on the scale of 10 tell how confident you are about the answer."""

    input: Input = dspy.InputField()
    output: Output = dspy.OutputField()


Now that we have the QASignature, let's define a Typed Predictor that executes this Signature while conforming to the type constraints.

predictor = dspy.TypedPredictor(QASignature)

Similar to other modules, we pass the QASignature to dspy.TypedPredictor which enforces the typed constraints.

And similarly to dspy.Predict, we can also use a "string signature", which we type as:

predictor = dspy.TypedPredictor("input:Input -> output:Output")

I/O in Typed Predictors
Now let's test out the Typed Predictor by providing some sample input to the predictor and verifying the output type. We can create an Input instance and pass it to the predictor to get a dictionary of the output.

doc_query_pair = Input(
    context="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    query="What does the fox jumps over?",
)

prediction = predictor(input=doc_query_pair)

Let's see the output and its type.

answer = prediction.output.answer
confidence_score = prediction.output.confidence

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}\n\n")
print(f"Answer: {answer}, Answer Type: {type(answer)}")
print(f"Confidence Score: {confidence_score}, Confidence Score Type: {type(confidence_score)}")


Typed Chain of Thoughts with dspy.TypedChainOfThought
Extending the analogous comparison of TypedPredictor to dspy.Predict, we create TypedChainOfThought, the typed counterpart of dspy.ChainOfThought:

cot_predictor = dspy.TypedChainOfThought(QASignature)

doc_query_pair = Input(
    context="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    query="What does the fox jumps over?",
)

prediction = cot_predictor(input=doc_query_pair)

1. Understanding the Goal
Our goal is to:

Use Pydantic to model Gherkin features, scenarios, and steps.
Parse Gherkin files into these models.
Use Typed Predictors (dspy.TypedPredictor) to process these models.
Implement concepts from the papers, such as ensuring semantic consistency between requirements and code, reusability of scenarios, and converting Gherkin into models for testing.
2. Representing Gherkin in Pydantic Models
2.1. Defining Pydantic Models for Gherkin Elements
We'll start by defining Pydantic models for the Gherkin elements: Feature, Scenario, Step, etc.

python
Copy code
# models.py

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional


class Step(BaseModel):
    keyword: str  # Given, When, Then, And, But
    text: str
    doc_string: Optional[str] = None
    table: Optional[List[List[str]]] = None


class Scenario(BaseModel):
    keyword: str  # Scenario or Scenario Outline
    name: str
    steps: List[Step]
    examples: Optional[List[dict]] = None  # For Scenario Outlines


class Feature(BaseModel):
    keyword: str = "Feature"
    name: str
    description: Optional[str] = None
    background: Optional[Scenario] = None
    scenarios: List[Scenario]
    tags: Optional[List[str]] = None
Explanation:

Step: Represents a Gherkin step, such as Given, When, Then, along with optional doc strings or data tables.
Scenario: Represents a Gherkin scenario, which contains multiple steps.
Feature: Represents a Gherkin feature, which contains multiple scenarios.
3. Parsing Gherkin Files into Pydantic Models
3.1. Using the gherkin-official Parser
We'll use the gherkin-official package to parse Gherkin files. Install it using:

bash
Copy code
pip install gherkin-official
3.2. Implementing the Parser
We'll write a function to parse a Gherkin file and convert it into our Pydantic models.

python
Copy code
# parser.py

import gherkin
from typing import List
from models import Feature, Scenario, Step


def parse_gherkin_file(file_path: str) -> Feature:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        gherkin_document = gherkin.parser.Parser().parse(file.read())

    gherkin_feature = gherkin_document['feature']
    feature = Feature(
        name=gherkin_feature['name'],
        description=gherkin_feature.get('description', None),
        scenarios=[]
    )

    for child in gherkin_feature['children']:
        if 'scenario' in child:
            scenario = parse_scenario(child['scenario'])
            feature.scenarios.append(scenario)
        elif 'background' in child:
            feature.background = parse_scenario(child['background'])

    return feature


def parse_scenario(gherkin_scenario: dict) -> Scenario:
    scenario = Scenario(
        keyword=gherkin_scenario['keyword'],
        name=gherkin_scenario['name'],
        steps=[parse_step(step) for step in gherkin_scenario['steps']],
        examples=gherkin_scenario.get('examples', None)
    )
    return scenario


def parse_step(gherkin_step: dict) -> Step:
    step = Step(
        keyword=gherkin_step['keyword'].strip(),
        text=gherkin_step['text'],
        doc_string=gherkin_step.get('docString', {}).get('content', None),
        table=parse_table(gherkin_step.get('dataTable', None))
    )
    return step


def parse_table(gherkin_table: dict) -> Optional[List[List[str]]]:
    if gherkin_table:
        return [row['cells'] for row in gherkin_table['rows']]
    return None
Explanation:

parse_gherkin_file: Reads a Gherkin file and parses it into a Feature model.
parse_scenario: Parses a Gherkin scenario into a Scenario model.
parse_step: Parses a Gherkin step into a Step model.
parse_table: Parses a Gherkin data table into a list of lists.
4. Processing Gherkin Models with Typed Predictors
Now that we have our Gherkin content represented as Pydantic models, we can use Typed Predictors to process them.

4.1. Defining Input and Output Models
We need to define input and output models for the Typed Predictor.

python
Copy code
# typed_predictors.py

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List
from models import Feature, Scenario, Step


class GherkinInput(BaseModel):
    feature: Feature


class CodeGenerationOutput(BaseModel):
    code_files: List[str] = Field(description="List of generated code file names.")
4.2. Creating Typed Predictors
We'll create a Typed Predictor that takes the Gherkin input and generates code files.

python
Copy code
import dspy
from dspy import InputField, OutputField, Signature, TypedPredictor

class CodeGenerationSignature(Signature):
    """
    Generate code files based on the provided Gherkin feature.
    """
    input: GherkinInput = InputField()
    output: CodeGenerationOutput = OutputField()


code_generator = TypedPredictor(CodeGenerationSignature)
5. Generating Code or Tests from Gherkin Models
5.1. Generating Test Code
We'll define a function that uses the Typed Predictor to generate test code from the Gherkin feature.

python
Copy code
def generate_test_code(feature: Feature) -> CodeGenerationOutput:
    # Create input instance
    gherkin_input = GherkinInput(feature=feature)
    
    # Run the predictor
    prediction = code_generator(input=gherkin_input)
    
    return prediction.output
Note: The actual implementation of the code generation logic inside the TypedPredictor would involve prompting an LLM to generate code based on the input feature. For the sake of this example, we'll simulate this.

6. Aligning with the Papers' Concepts
6.1. Ensuring Semantic Consistency
By parsing Gherkin files into structured Pydantic models and using Typed Predictors to generate code or tests, we ensure that the generated artifacts are directly based on the specified requirements. This aligns with the concept from the first paper:

"AgileGen attempts for the first time to use testable requirements by Gherkin for semantic consistency between requirements and code."

6.2. Enhancing BDD Practices
By modeling Gherkin in Pydantic and automating code generation, we enhance BDD practices, making scenarios reusable and automating test code generation, as discussed in the second paper.

7. Complete Example
Let's put it all together with a complete example.

7.1. Sample Gherkin Feature File
Create a file sample.feature:

gherkin
Copy code
Feature: Login functionality

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid credentials
    Then the user is redirected to the dashboard

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters invalid credentials
    Then an error message is displayed
7.2. Full Implementation Code
We'll write a script main.py that uses all the components we've defined.

python
Copy code
# main.py

from parser import parse_gherkin_file
from typed_predictors import generate_test_code
from models import Feature
import dspy

# Initialize dspy with appropriate settings (e.g., OpenAI API key)
dspy.settings.configure(lm=dspy.OpenAI(api_key='YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'))

def main():
    # Parse the Gherkin feature file
    feature = parse_gherkin_file('sample.feature')
    
    # Generate test code using the Typed Predictor
    code_output = generate_test_code(feature)
    
    # Output the generated code files (simulated here)
    for file_name in code_output.code_files:
        print(f"Generated code file: {file_name}")
    
    # Simulate writing code files
    for scenario in feature.scenarios:
        file_name = f"test_{scenario.name.replace(' ', '_').lower()}.py"
        with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
            # Simulate code content
            f.write(f"# Test code for scenario: {scenario.name}\n")
            for step in scenario.steps:
                f.write(f"# {step.keyword} {step.text}\n")
        print(f"Test code generated for scenario '{scenario.name}' in file '{file_name}'")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Explanation:

Parse Gherkin File: We parse the sample.feature file into a Feature model.
Generate Test Code: We use the generate_test_code function, which internally uses a TypedPredictor to process the feature.
Simulate Code Generation: For demonstration, we write simple test code files for each scenario.
8. Conclusion
By representing Gherkin in Pydantic models and using Typed Predictors, we've:

Implemented the concepts from the papers: Ensured semantic consistency between requirements and code, enhanced BDD practices, and automated test code generation.
Provided a framework for human-AI teamwork: Users can define requirements in Gherkin, and AI can assist in generating consistent code or tests.
Enhanced Reusability and Modularity: By modeling steps and scenarios, we can reuse them across different tests or features.
Next Steps:

Integrate LLMs: Implement the actual code generation logic using LLMs like GPT-4 via dspy.OpenAI.
Handle Scenario Outlines and Examples: Extend the models and code to support scenario outlines with examples.
Implement Error Handling: Add robust error handling for parsing and prediction steps.
Enhance Test Code Generation: Generate actual executable test code compatible with testing frameworks like unittest or pytest.
References to the Papers:

ChatGPT

Thought for 21 seconds

Certainly! I apologize for not meeting your expectations earlier. Let's start by creating a C4 model of the system proposed in the papers and then implement it using a Typer CLI without any additional dependencies.

C4 Model Diagrams
We'll focus on the first paper, "Empowering Agile-Based Generative Software Development through Human-AI Teamwork", which introduces AgileGen, an agile-based generative software development system through human-AI teamwork.

Since I can't provide visual diagrams here, I'll describe each level of the C4 model in text.

Level 1: System Context Diagram
AgileGen System is at the center, interacting with external actors.

Primary System: AgileGen
Actors:
Users: Provide initial raw requirements and participate in decision-making.
Developers: Collaborate with the system to refine requirements and code.
Interactions:
Users input raw requirements into AgileGen.
AgileGen uses AI to interpret and expand requirements.
AgileGen presents testable requirements using Gherkin to users for validation.
Developers use the generated code and provide feedback.
Level 2: Container Diagram
AgileGen consists of several containers:

User Interface (UI):
Allows users to input requirements.
Displays generated Gherkin scenarios and code.
Requirement Processor:
Parses user input.
Generates testable Gherkin scenarios.
AI Engine:
Enhances requirements using AI.
Ensures semantic consistency between requirements and code.
Code Generator:
Generates code based on Gherkin scenarios.
Memory Pool:
Stores user decision-making scenarios.
Recommends scenarios to new users.
Level 3: Component Diagram
Breaking down the Requirement Processor and AI Engine:

Requirement Processor Components:
Input Parser:
Processes raw user requirements.
Gherkin Generator:
Converts parsed requirements into Gherkin scenarios.
AI Engine Components:
Semantic Analyzer:
Checks for semantic consistency.
AI Enhancer:
Uses AI to fill in incomplete requirements.
Feedback Loop:
Interacts with users to refine requirements.
Memory Pool Components:
Scenario Database:
Stores past user scenarios.
Recommendation System:
Suggests scenarios based on stored data.
Implementation with Typer CLI
We'll create a Typer CLI application that:

Accepts raw user requirements.
Generates Gherkin scenarios.
Uses a simple AI simulation to enhance requirements.
Ensures semantic consistency.
Stores user scenarios in a memory pool.
Recommends scenarios to new users.
Since we're not using any external dependencies beyond Typer and the standard library, we'll simulate AI behavior.

Gherkin Scenario Generation:

generate_gherkin_scenario() converts the enhanced requirement into a simple Gherkin scenario.
CLI Commands:

input_requirement: Allows users to input requirements, simulates AI enhancement, generates Gherkin scenarios, and saves accepted scenarios to the memory pool.
generate_code: Generates code files for each scenario in the memory pool (simulation).
recommend: Recommends the last three scenarios from the memory pool to new users.
No External Dependencies:

Only uses typer and standard Python libraries (os, json, etc.).

Empowering Agile-Based Generative Software Development through Human-AI Teamwork

Authors: Sai Zhang, Zhenchang Xing, Ronghui Guo, Fangzhou Xu, Lei Chen, Zhaoyuan Zhang, Xiaowang Zhang, Zhiyong Feng, Zhiqiang Zhuang

Abstract: In software development, the raw requirements proposed by users are frequently incomplete, which impedes the complete implementation of application functionalities. With the emergence of large language models, recent methods with the top-down waterfall model employ a questioning approach for requirement completion, attempting to explore further user requirements. However, users, constrained by their domain knowledge, lack effective acceptance criteria, which fail to capture the implicit needs of the user. Moreover, the cumulative errors of the waterfall model can lead to discrepancies between the generated code and user requirements. The Agile methodologies reduce cumulative errors through lightweight iteration and collaboration with users, but the challenge lies in ensuring semantic consistency between user requirements and the code generated. We propose AgileGen, an agile-based generative software development through human-AI teamwork. AgileGen attempts for the first time to use testable requirements by Gherkin for semantic consistency between requirements and code. Additionally, we innovate in human-AI teamwork, allowing users to participate in decision-making processes they do well and enhancing the completeness of application functionality. Finally, to improve the reliability of user scenarios, a memory pool mechanism is used to collect user decision-making scenarios and recommend them to new users. AgileGen, as a user-friendly interactive system, significantly outperformed existing best methods by 16.4% and garnered higher user satisfaction. △ Less

Advancing BDD Software Testing: Dynamic Scenario Re-Usability And Step Auto-Complete For Cucumber Framework

Authors: A. H. Mughal

Abstract: This paper presents and implements the re-usability of scenarios within scenarios for behavior-driven development (BDD) Gherkin test scripts in the Cucumber Java framework. Though the focus of the presented work is on scenario re-usability through an implementation within the Cucumber BDD Java framework, the paper also dives a little into the limitations of Cucumber single-threaded scenario execution model. This implementation increases the modularity and efficiency of the test suite. The paper also discusses VSCode step definition auto-completion integration, simplifying the test script writing process. This functionality is handy to Quality Assurance(QA) test writers, allowing instant access to relevant step definitions. In addition, the use of these methods in a popular continuous integration and delivery platform Jenkins as a Maven Java project is discussed. This integration with Jenkins, facilitates for more efficient test automation for continuous deployment scenarios. Empirical research and practical applications reveal significant improvements in the speed and efficiency of test writing, which is especially valuable for large and complex software projects. Integrating these methods into traditional sequential BDD practices paves the way towards more effective, efficient, and sustainable test automation strategies. △ Less

Verifying Web Applications: From Business Level Specifications to Automated Model-Based Testing

Authors: Christian Colombo, Mark Micallef, Mark Scerri

Abstract: One of reasons preventing a wider uptake of model-based testing in the industry is the difficulty which is encountered by developers when trying to think in terms of properties rather than linear specifications. A disparity has traditionally been perceived between the language spoken by customers who specify the system and the language required to construct models of that system. The dynamic nature of the specifications for commercial systems further aggravates this problem in that models would need to be rechecked after every specification change. In this paper, we propose an approach for converting specifications written in the commonly-used quasi-natural language Gherkin into models for use with a model-based testing tool. We have instantiated this approach using QuickCheck and demonstrate its applicability via a case study on the eHealth system, the national health portal for Maltese residents. △ Less

Conclusion
By representing the concepts from the papers with Pydantic models, we create a structured and type-validated representation of complex ideas in software development and testing. These models can serve as the foundation for:

Automating the generation of code and tests based on user requirements and Gherkin scenarios.
Facilitating human-AI collaboration by clearly defining inputs and outputs in the development process.
Enhancing BDD practices by modeling reusable scenarios and step definitions.
Bridging the gap between business and technical languages through models that represent both specifications and system behaviors.
These Pydantic models not only help in ensuring data integrity and validation but also make the concepts programmatically accessible, enabling further development of tools and systems that implement the ideas presented in the papers.

Additional Notes
Extensibility: The models can be extended with additional fields and methods to support more features, such as serialization to JSON or interaction with databases.
Integration with Typer CLI: These models can be used in a Typer CLI application to accept user inputs, process data, and provide outputs in a structured manner.
No External Dependencies: Apart from Pydantic (which is requested), no additional dependencies are used, making the models lightweight and focused.
If you have any specific areas you'd like to delve deeper into or need further assistance with implementing these models in a particular context, feel free to ask!

Combine predict_types and Jinja templates to loop through the papers
ChatGPT

Thought for 9 seconds

Certainly! Let's combine predict_types from your typed_predictors_tools.py module and Jinja templates to process the papers. The goal is to loop through each paper, use predict_types to extract concepts and represent them as Pydantic models, and then render those models using Jinja templates.

Overview
Objective
Process each paper: Use predict_types to extract concepts from each paper's abstract.
Generate Pydantic models: Represent the extracted concepts as Pydantic models.
Render with Jinja templates: Use Jinja templates to render the models into code or documentation.
Loop through the papers: Automate the process for all provided papers.
Approach
Setup:
Import necessary modules (pydantic, jinja2, etc.).
Initialize predict_types from typed_predictors_tools.py.
Process Papers:
Loop over each paper.
Extract the abstract and relevant information.
Use predict_types:
Define input and output Pydantic models.
Use predict_types to generate Pydantic models representing the paper's concepts.
Render with Jinja:
Create Jinja templates to format the Pydantic models into code or documentation.
Render the templates with the generated data.
Output:
Display or save the rendered output.
Implementation Steps
1. Setup
1.1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have the following packages installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pydantic jinja2 typer
pydantic: For data validation and settings management.
jinja2: For template rendering.
typer: For building CLI applications (if needed).
1.2. Import Modules
python
Copy code
# main.py

import os
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader, select_autoescape
from typed_predictors_tools import predict_type, PredictType  # Assuming this is available
import typer  # Optional, for CLI
2. Prepare the Papers
We'll store the papers in a list of dictionaries for processing.

python
Copy code
# List of papers

papers = [
    {
        "title": "Empowering Agile-Based Generative Software Development through Human-AI Teamwork",
        "authors": [
            "Sai Zhang", "Zhenchang Xing", "Ronghui Guo", "Fangzhou Xu", "Lei Chen",
            "Zhaoyuan Zhang", "Xiaowang Zhang", "Zhiyong Feng", "Zhiqiang Zhuang"
        ],
        "abstract": """
In software development, the raw requirements proposed by users are frequently incomplete, which impedes the complete implementation of application functionalities. With the emergence of large language models, recent methods with the top-down waterfall model employ a questioning approach for requirement completion, attempting to explore further user requirements. However, users, constrained by their domain knowledge, lack effective acceptance criteria, which fail to capture the implicit needs of the user. Moreover, the cumulative errors of the waterfall model can lead to discrepancies between the generated code and user requirements. The Agile methodologies reduce cumulative errors through lightweight iteration and collaboration with users, but the challenge lies in ensuring semantic consistency between user requirements and the code generated. We propose AgileGen, an agile-based generative software development through human-AI teamwork. AgileGen attempts for the first time to use testable requirements by Gherkin for semantic consistency between requirements and code. Additionally, we innovate in human-AI teamwork, allowing users to participate in decision-making processes they do well and enhancing the completeness of application functionality. Finally, to improve the reliability of user scenarios, a memory pool mechanism is used to collect user decision-making scenarios and recommend them to new users. AgileGen, as a user-friendly interactive system, significantly outperformed existing best methods by 16.4% and garnered higher user satisfaction.

        "title": "Advancing BDD Software Testing",
        "authors": ["A. H. Mughal"],
        "abstract": """
This paper presents and implements the re-usability of scenarios within scenarios for behavior-driven development (BDD) Gherkin test scripts in the Cucumber Java framework. Though the focus of the presented work is on scenario re-usability through an implementation within the Cucumber BDD Java framework, the paper also dives a little into the limitations of Cucumber single-threaded scenario execution model. This implementation increases the modularity and efficiency of the test suite. The paper also discusses VSCode step definition auto-completion integration, simplifying the test script writing process. This functionality is handy to Quality Assurance (QA) test writers, allowing instant access to relevant step definitions. In addition, the use of these methods in a popular continuous integration and delivery platform Jenkins as a Maven Java project is discussed. This integration with Jenkins facilitates more efficient test automation for continuous deployment scenarios. Empirical research and practical applications reveal significant improvements in the speed and efficiency of test writing, which is especially valuable for large and complex software projects. Integrating these methods into traditional sequential BDD practices paves the way towards more effective, efficient, and sustainable test automation strategies.

        "abstract": """
One of the reasons preventing a wider uptake of model-based testing in the industry is the difficulty which is encountered by developers when trying to think in terms of properties rather than linear specifications. A disparity has traditionally been perceived between the language spoken by customers who specify the system and the language required to construct models of that system. The dynamic nature of the specifications for commercial systems further aggravates this problem in that models would need to be rechecked after every specification change. In this paper, we propose an approach for converting specifications written in the commonly-used quasi-natural language Gherkin into models for use with a model-based testing tool. We have instantiated this approach using QuickCheck and demonstrate its applicability via a case study on the eHealth system, the national health portal for Maltese residents.

3. Define Pydantic Models for Input and Output
3.1. Input Model
python
Copy code
class PaperInput(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(..., description="The title of the paper.")
    abstract: str = Field(..., description="The abstract of the paper.")
3.2. Output Model
We will ask the LLM to generate a list of concepts from the abstract and represent them as Pydantic models.

python
Copy code
class Concept(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the concept.")
    description: str = Field(..., description="A description of the concept.")

class PaperConceptsOutput(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(..., description="The title of the paper.")
    concepts: List[Concept] = Field(..., description="A list of concepts extracted from the paper.")
4. Initialize the LLM (Simulated)
Since we might not have access to an actual LLM in this environment, we'll simulate the predict_type function.

python
Copy code
def predict_type(input_data: dict, output_model: BaseModel) -> BaseModel:
    """
    Simulated predict_type function.
    """
    # For demonstration, we'll hardcode some concepts based on the title
    title = input_data['title']
    if "Agile-Based Generative Software Development" in title:
        concepts = [
            {"name": "Incomplete Requirements", "description": "Users often provide incomplete requirements."},
            {"name": "Semantic Consistency", "description": "Ensuring code aligns with requirements."},
            {"name": "Gherkin", "description": "A language for testable requirements."},
            {"name": "Human-AI Teamwork", "description": "Collaboration between humans and AI in development."},
            {"name": "Memory Pool", "description": "Collecting user scenarios for recommendations."},
        ]
    elif "Advancing BDD Software Testing" in title:
        concepts = [
            {"name": "Scenario Reusability", "description": "Reusing scenarios within other scenarios."},
            {"name": "Step Auto-Completion", "description": "Simplifying test script writing."},
            {"name": "Modularity", "description": "Increasing efficiency of the test suite."},
            {"name": "Integration with Jenkins", "description": "Facilitating efficient test automation."},
        ]

            {"name": "Business-Level Specifications", "description": "Bridging customer language and system models."},
            {"name": "QuickCheck", "description": "A tool for property-based testing."},
        ]
    else:
        concepts = []

    output = output_model(title=title, concepts=concepts)
    return output
Note: In a real implementation, predict_type would invoke an LLM to generate the concepts based on the abstract.

5. Set Up Jinja Templates
Create a directory called templates and inside it, create a file paper_concepts.jinja2.

jinja2
Copy code
{# templates/paper_concepts.jinja2 #}

# Concepts Extracted from "{{ title }}"

{% for concept in concepts %}
## {{ concept.name }}

{{ concept.description }}

---

{% endfor %}
6. Main Processing Loop
python
Copy code
def main():
    # Set up Jinja2 environment
    env = Environment(
        loader=FileSystemLoader(searchpath="./templates"),
        autoescape=select_autoescape(['jinja2'])
    )
    template = env.get_template("paper_concepts.jinja2")

    # Loop through the papers
    for paper in papers:
        # Prepare input data
        input_data = {
            "title": paper["title"],
            "abstract": paper["abstract"],
        }

        # Use predict_type to generate concepts
        output = predict_type(input_data, PaperConceptsOutput)

        # Render the output with Jinja template
        rendered_output = template.render(
            title=output.title,
            concepts=output.concepts
        )

        # Save or display the rendered output
        filename = f"{output.title.replace(' ', '_')}.md"
        with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(rendered_output)

        print(f"Processed '{output.title}' and saved to '{filename}'")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
7. Resulting Files

Conclusion
By combining predict_types and Jinja templates, we've:

Automated the extraction of concepts from each paper using a simulated predict_type function.
Represented these concepts as Pydantic models, ensuring type safety and data validation.
Rendered the concepts using Jinja templates, producing neatly formatted Markdown documents.
Looped through all provided papers, automating the process for multiple inputs.
This approach can be extended and enhanced by:

Integrating an actual LLM in predict_type to generate concepts based on the abstract.
Expanding the templates to generate code, documentation, or other formats as needed.
Using predict_types concurrently for large datasets, as supported by the original predict_types function in typed_predictors_tools.py.
Notes
Error Handling: In a production environment, add error handling for file operations and LLM responses.
Asynchronous Execution: For large numbers of papers, consider using asynchronous processing or multi-threading.
Customization: Adjust the Jinja templates to suit your specific output requirements.
If you need further assistance or have questions about specific parts of the implementation, feel free to ask!

5.3 RQ3: What is the human-computer interaction experience for end-users during the AgileGen process?
Previous RQs evaluated our method’s performance in generating software applications without human interaction for
fairness. However, our method ensures semantic consistency between user requirements and agent generation and
supports end-user participation in software development. It enables collaborative development using the behaviordriven testing language Gherkin to clarify user stories through user-agent interactions. Agile methodologies inspire
this iterative approach and incorporates user feedback to enhance project development. Thus, it’s essential to explore
our framework’s effectiveness in interactive experiences and the impact of human interaction on generating software
applications.
5.3.1 RQ3.1: How effective is our method regarding human-computer interaction experience metrics?
Motivation. The human-computer interaction experience of end-users is also crucial for generative software
development agents. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the effectiveness of our framework in terms of interaction
experience.
Methodology. To explore RQ3.1, we will introduce the following aspects: a. Human Evaluation Metrics, b. Baselines,
and c. Experimental Setup.
a. Human Evaluation Metrics: We use the Likert Scale [48] to evaluate our method’s human-computer interaction
(HCI) experience. HCI is crucial for measuring the AgileGen, as users interact with it while generating website
Manuscript submitted to ACM
Empowering Agile-Based Generative Software Development through Human-AI Teamwork 35
Fig. 17. Comparison of human-computer interaction experience results. Each coordinate represents a dimension of interaction. The
square markers represent the results of our method based on GPT-3.5 (Our (3.5)), while the circular markers represent the evaluation
results of our method based on GPT-4 (Our (4)).
applications. We used the User Interaction Experience Scale by Wu et al. [48]. to assess HCI, which was scored on a
seven-point Likert scale. This scale includes questions on "Match Goal," "Think Through," "Transparent," "Controllable,"
and "Collaborative."
b. Baselines. We will test our method on different base models: one based on GPT-3.5, referred to as Our (3.5), and
another based on GPT-4, referred to as Our (4). These two versions have identical implementation details, and we can
switch between different models by modifying the ‘model’ parameter in the tool configuration.
c. Experimental Setup. Participants: To conduct a human evaluation of our method’s human-computer interaction
experience, we recruited 20 individuals from various industries, different from the participants in RQ1.2. We designed
a detailed email invitation explaining the study’s purpose and tasks and offering a small financial compensation of
$20 per person. Twelve of these participants were male, and eight were female. 45% came from various professions,
including Consulting Media, Design Industry, Education, Finance, Medical Treatment, Service, and Online Retailers.
55% were students from other institutions: 6 majoring in software engineering, 1 in computer science and technology, 2
in new media and communication, and 2 in network engineering. Regarding age distribution, 55% were aged 18˜24, 35%
were aged 25˜34, and 10% were aged 35˜44. Among the 20 participants, 5 had only basic computer operation knowledge,
7 were novice programmers (0˜1 year of experience), 4 were beginners (1˜3 years of experience), and 4 were experienced
programmers (more than three years of experience). These participants had never been involved in any stage of our
development and had no overlap with the participants from RQ1.2, ensuring their evaluations were objective and
unbiased.
Study procedure: To ensure participants understand the Likert Scale scoring rules and our method’s usage and
interaction process, we organized an online training session for the 20 participants. We selected one web application
each from the "50projects50days" and "SRDD" datasets not chosen for evaluation to show our interaction process,
including user decision-making and iterative acceptance and recommendation interactions. During the training session,
we simulated the scoring operation using the Likert Scale. The session included a Q&A segment to confirm that
participants had no doubts. After the training, each participant was randomly assigned to test six projects from the two
datasets using our method. Participants were allowed to modify and improve features according to their needs. After
testing each project, participants were asked to rate it using the Likert Scale scoring form. Finally, we interviewed the
participants to gather their feedback on our method.
Result Analysis. As shown in Figure 17, AgileGen performs well in human-computer interaction, scoring above
average on all five metrics, with high stability and a notable "Match goal" score based on GPT-4. Participants praised its

controllability, noting they could modify the web application as needed and add or remove features after the initial
generation. Many found using natural language for web project development enjoyable, allowing them to focus on
planning features rather than implementation details. Most participants engaged in about three interaction modifications
(here, interaction refers to scenarios decision-making and acceptance & recommendation decision-making, not the
number of button clicks) per project in the experiment. Interestingly, some gave a high "Match goal" score for the
"09 Sound Board" project, which had a 0% task completeness score in the automatic evaluation due to the lack of
multimedia audio. One participant’s simple request, "I want to be able to click on a card and read it automatically." led
to iterative modifications using the Web Speech API’s "speechSynthesis" for speech synthesis. In summary, our method
is "transparent" and "controllable," allowing easy requirement modifications and improving the "Match goal" metric
through iterative processes. It engages end-users in decision-making, making it more "collaborative" and beneficial for
those lacking software development expertise.
5.3.2 RQ3.2: How does the human-agent collaboration process affect the generation of software applications?
Motivation. The above experiments demonstrate that users have a good experience when interacting with our
method in human-agent interactions. Although the "Match goal" metric can reflect the impact of human-agent collaboration on the generated results, it is not very intuitive. Exploring the impact of human-agent interaction on the
generation of software applications through case studies will provide a more direct view of the changes and impacts
during interactions, showcasing user-decision details.
Methodology. We find three projects from the participant evaluations that performed poorly in automatic generation
but showed significant improvement after the human-agent collaboration process. We will showcase these three projects.
Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method using the task description from [30]: "design a basic Gomoku
game." We have prepared a replication package 23 for public validation of the experiment.
Result Analysis. The "09 Sound Board" project 24 showcases the user decision-making process, as illustrated in
Figure 18. The initial task description is: "I’d like a website that displays cards with words and plays sounds when
clicked." Due to the need for multimedia audio, no methods complete the sound playback functionality during automatic
generation. We recorded a participant’s entire testing process, consisting of five rounds of iterative modifications.
Initially, two scenarios are provided, and the participant makes no changes. The "Round 1" result shows a predominantly
gray and white theme. The participant then suggests a visual modification: "I want more colors for kids, instead of
off-white," leading to a colorful page in "Round 2." Next, the participant requests more word cards: "I think two cards are
too few. Please list more word cards." In "Round 3," the number of cards increases to five, maintaining consistent themes.
In the fourth iteration, the participant asks for an automatic reading feature: "I want to be able to click on a card and
read it automatically," resulting in a modification using the Web Speech API to read the card. Finally, the participant
suggests another visual change, preferring bright colors. In "Round 5," the page is adjusted to use brighter orange tones,
including card colors. This interaction demonstrates that participants can freely modify functionality and visual effects
using natural language. Moreover, the human-agent interaction process helps complete the generation of the software
application’s functionalities.

Fig. 18. The interaction showcases for the "09 Sound Board" project includes AgileGen’s interaction system on the left and the
generated end-user web application interface on the right. The participant made five iterative modifications to the project, including
visual design and functionality changes.
Next, the "48 Random Image Feed" project 25 is chosen as the second example, illustrated in Figure 19. The initial task
description is: "I need a web page that can randomly display some pictures, and these pictures are displayed in the form
of a table." This project focuses on image arrangement and display. During participant interaction, an interesting process
unfolds. The participant deletes the scenarios they deem unnecessary and adds their scenario description: "Scenario 2: I
want random images to be displayed in different categories according to the topic of the images." The "Round 1" result
includes the requested categorization, but the images are placeholders. Then, the participant provides an API link as
part of the modification description to enhance functionality: "Use the real API https://picsum.photos/200/200?random
to display the image." The "Round 2" result shows the web application using this external API to display images. This
example demonstrates our method’s ability to integrate custom APIs to achieve more complex functionalities.

generated end-user web application interface on the right. The participant made scenarios decision-making and went through 2
rounds of iterative modifications.
Fig. 20. The results are shown before and after interaction for the "Shot_Accuracy_Trainer" and "Gomoku Game" projects. On the left
is the state before human interaction, and on the right is after the interaction.
Finally, we compare the web application before and after human interaction, as shown in Figure 20. In the
"Shot_Accuracy_Trainer" project 26, the initial generation tends to create a record-keeping website, overlooking
that it is a basketball shooting game. User interaction clarifies (The Code Modification suggested: "Virtual training is a
shooting game. I can click the button after the force has a small ball that can shoot.") that it is a game and generates the

corresponding shooting functionalities. In the "Gomoku Game" project 27, the initial generation has already completed
the rules and functionality of the Gomoku game. After the interaction, the board and pieces appear more aesthetically
pleasing.
Findings in RQ3: Our AgileGen has established a user-friendly interaction interface for end-users. The human
evaluations have shown that our method can better achieve its objectives, enhancing the sense of participation
and collaboration for end-users during the system operation process. The case studies clearly and intuitively
demonstrate the participants’ interaction processes and the changes in the generated web applications. In summary,
our method can generate high-quality software code and offer a superior interaction experience.
6 DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss the introduction of external tools, the hidden costs of user decisions, and the scalability and
generalizability of our framework, based on some error analysis.
External tools with Discussion: We discuss the issue of external tools on two levels: the Potential benefits of
integrating external tools into Our method and the benefit of introducing external tools to generate software applications.
1) Potential Benefits of Integrating External Tools into Our Method: Our method integrates the SQLite3 external
database tool in the memory pool to save human decision experiences. SQLite3 was chosen because it is an open-source,
lightweight, embedded relational database management system that does not require server configuration. SQLite3
supports most SQL standard syntax, allowing us to use SQL syntax to access human experiences in the database.
Of course, if we need high concurrency and complex query functions in the future, it can easily be integrated with
server-side database management tools. More importantly, our method is based on behavior-driven development (BDD),
with the scenario design module containing users’ clarified Gherkin scenarios. These Gherkin scenarios serve as test
cases, and in the future, we can directly integrate the external Cucumber testing tool to conduct tests. The feedback
from these test cases can be used to improve code quality. Since Gherkin focuses more on the consistency between
implementation code and business logic, introducing the Cucumber testing tool will help generate software applications
that align with user expectations, reducing manual iterations. For example, the initial scenario generation in the "09
Sound Board" project includes "Then the website plays the pronunciation of the word ’Apple.’" However, "Round 1"
does not generate the pronunciation functionality. If we introduce the external Cucumber tool, it would automatically
test and modify the functionality, reducing the need for additional manual iterations. This will be a key focus of our
future research.
2) Benefits of Introducing External Tools to Our Generated Software Applications: During software applications generation, large language models (e.g., GPT-4) have hallucination problems, resulting in generated real multimedia API failure.
To maintain the display effect of web application interfaces, we typically replace multimedia resources with placeholders
during automatic generation. However, some projects rely on images to present their visual effects. Placeholder images
are often gray and provide a poor visual experience, which can result in participants giving lower visual scores even if
the functionality is complete. For example, the project "ID50 Catch The Insect" should involve clicking on insect images
to catch them, but the game theme can be confusing without the insect images. Similarly, the "ID48 Random Image Feed"
project requires multimedia resources for display, but automatically generated resource links often do not meet the
requirements. Our method allows for specifying certain resource APIs through human-agent collaboration, as shown
27https://github.com/HarrisClover/AgileGen-Human-Agent-Interaction-Experiment/tree/main/Gomoku
Manuscript submitted to ACM
40 S. Zhang et al.
in Figure 19. This interaction process made us realize that incorporating external API tools can enable our generated
end-user applications to achieve more complex functionalities. In the "SRDD" dataset, for instance, the "NewsMeter"
project aims to complete a news credibility analysis function, as shown in Figure 14. Our method generates a reasonable
simulation process, including data display interfaces in the code. If a suitable news analysis API is introduced, it could
easily result in a genuine news analysis website system. Of course, we need to consider the reliable sources and stable
references of APIs and the different response schemas of each API. Completing the functionality of an API with complex
input and output data may require further restricting the generation format of software applications. In summary, the
introduction of external API tools would enhance the scope of applications generated by our method, and we will
consider this in our future work.
Hidden Costs of User Decisions: In our method, users can participate in decision-making steps, including "end-user
requirements decision-making," "scenario decision-making," and "acceptance & recommendation decision-making."
Therefore, we discuss these in three parts.
1) “End-User Requirements Decision-making": This is when users propose the initial requirements for the software
applications in our system. Our method accommodates requirements that are simple natural language descriptions, as
shown in Table 3, rather than complex requirement specifications. This reduces the domain knowledge and learning
costs required from end-users during the requirements decision-making.
2) “Scenario Decision-making": This involves users adding, deleting, or modifying the generated Gherkin scenarios
in our system to clarify their requirements further. We designed a memory pool module to reduce the time cost for
users when modifying scenarios. This module accumulates previous user decision experiences and recommends similar
scenarios for future similar projects. However, to ensure fairness in the experimental setup, we did not provide any
human experience before testing all projects, so the impact of the memory pool can only be measured later. Our design
mechanism accumulates human experiences over time, reducing user decision costs as more tests are conducted. In
the future, we plan to deploy our method on a public testing platform to collect more human experiences over time,
demonstrating the process of continuous enhancement through human-in-the-loop interactions. Additionally, we built
an interaction bridge to reduce the learning cost for users when adding and modifying Gherkin scenarios, allowing
users to add and modify functionalities using natural language seamlessly.
3) “Acceptance & Recommendation Decision-making": This allows users to review the software application and
iteratively recommend modifications in our system. To reduce the learning cost for users when executing applications
during acceptance, we set up a "Code Execution Link" in the system. Users can click the link easily to test the web
application interface. To reduce the number of iterations for user recommendation decisions, we designed a consistency
factor that automatically modifies the code to improve alignment with user requirements. Lastly, we can further reduce
the number of manual iterative recommendation modifications in the future. Since our method is based on behaviordriven development (BDD), we can easily introduce the external tool Cucumber for automated testing of the generated
code and targeted modifications. This approach will significantly enhance the consistency between implementation
code and business logic, reducing user decision costs during "acceptance & recommendation decision-making."
Scalability and Generalizability Discussion: 1) In terms of scalability: First, our method is based on Gherkin
scenario test cases, which can easily be extended to include external Cucumber testing tools. This targeted modification
of the generated code would significantly improve code quality. Second, when facing future high concurrency and
complex queries in the human experience memory pool, the SQLite3 database can be expanded to MySQL or other
server-side data management systems. Finally, our system harnesses the capabilities of large language models but is not
limited to a specific model. Thus, it can be easily extended to various models, demonstrating high scalability.

2) In terms of generalizability: First, our framework can be applied to any software development project. By adopting
behavior-driven development (BDD) based on agile principles, we ensure the consistency of generated code with business
logic. This innovative behavior-driven code generation approach is not confined to web application development. If we
want our framework to support mobile application development, we can change the visual design components and the
programming language of the code generation components. Finally, our method has received high user satisfaction
and interaction experience ratings from participants in various industries, validating its generalizability in generating
software applications. Thus, our method demonstrates high generalizability in its framework design and final generated
software application.
7 RELATED WORK
This paper first introduces an AI agent for generative software development (AgileGen) based on an Agile methodologies
and through human-AI Teamwork. It allows end-users and AI to handle tasks they excel at, collaboratively piecing
together the development process. The related work is as follows:
7.1 Automated code generation
In recent years, automated code generation tasks have been achieved using deep learning to generate code automatically [4, 25, 39, 44, 45, 50]. Automated code generation tasks are divided into tree-based and token-based methods [39].
Tree-based methods generate code by producing tree structures or Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) [11, 25, 51]. Meanwhile,
token-based methods [4, 44, 45, 50] treat the input and output code as sequences of tokens. There is also a type of
template-based code generation. [42] is a tool for the automatic generation of web software and API code based on
templates. With the software of large pre-trained models in code generation tasks, token-based methods have shown remarkable results. CodeT5 [7] introduced identifier-aware pre-training tasks based on T5. CodeGPT [24], CodeBERT [12],
and CodeGeeX [21] utilize various programming languages for pre-training. CodeX [46] is a GPT-based model that
underwent pre-training on a large scale of GitHub code and launched a productivity version named GitHub Copilot [9].
These powerful pre-trained models can generate high-quality code snippets during software development, enhancing
developers’ productivity through pair programming. This lays the foundation for automatically generative software
development [35]. However, these large pre-trained code generation models mainly focus on generating high-quality
code snippets within a single file.
7.2 Generative Software Development
Generative software development has long been a focus of attention in industry and academia. Paolone et al. [27]
proposed a model-driven architecture (MDA)-based approach using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and xGenerator
to generate website applications. Boyalakuntla et al. [5] aimed to reduce smartphone battery consumption by creating a
meta-model and generating location-based software. Bernaschina et al. [3] developed a model-driven development tool
that automatically generates rapid prototypes of web and mobile software from Interaction Flow Modeling Language
(IFML) specifications.
Large language models such as ChatGPT [2] have been widely applied in software development and demonstrated
potential. Microsoft researchers Bubeck et al. [6] guide GPT-4 to the development of complex HTML games. Some
Python project generators based on GPT have been released on Huggingface [13], generating function architecture
based on brief requirements. AutoGPT [1] has been explored for generating HTML projects without manual prompting.
Intelligent tools can help developers be more productive, but they need precise models and expert knowledge to work

well. Similar projects include DemoGPT28, which utilizes the Streamlit visualization tool and can rapidly transform a
single prompt into an AI software with the prompted functionality. This fully autonomous AI operates without human
intervention in its internal processes and is prone to issues such as process freezing. Then, some questioning-based
agents have been proposed. GPT-Engineer [14] is a project that automates the software engineering process using
GPT-4, initially clarifying requirements through questions to the user before automatically generating code. Similarly,
gpt-pilot29, based on GPT-4, generates software code after asking developers to clarify questions. These methods aim to
assist developers; thus, the questions often require professional domain knowledge.
Recently, the concept of multi-agent collaboration has been introduced. Generative Agents [28] simulate human
behavior by allowing agents to interact collaboratively through dialogue. CodeAgent [41] conducts code reviews
through the collaboration of multiple agents led by a QA-checker. Inspired by this collaborative interaction among
agents, MetaGPT [17] utilizes standard operating procedures to coordinate a multi-agent system based on large language
models, with different agents simulating different software development roles. Subsequently, MetaGPT proposed a
solution for multi-agent collaboration in data science applications [16]. ChatDev first version [30] designs a dialogue
chain-guided, multi-agent collaborative software development agent. Based on the original prototype of ChatDev, two
versions were updated. The ChatDev second version [31] adopts experiential co-learning, collecting shortcut-oriented
experiences from their historical trajectory for use in software development. The ChatDev third version [32] refines
these historical experiences through iteration before using them in software development. The fourth version of
ChatDev [33] uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to organize agents. Employing topological sorting simplifies agent
interaction reasoning and enhances collaboration among agents. These agents follow the waterfall model, characterized
by heavy documentation and process emphasis. However, they offer lower levels of human participation and control,
and the hallucination errors of each agent can cascade, making it challenging to generate software products that meet
user requirements. As a result, these tools are not user-friendly for end-users who wish to tailored software in software
development.
7.3 Requirement Generation
Unclear requirements are a primary difficulty in generative software development, as end-users often need more
domain knowledge to articulate their needs precisely. The requirements are generally expressed in a natural language
of one to two sentences. The goal of the requirement generation task is to produce clear requirements. Existing
research on automated requirement generation primarily focuses on converting (semi-)structured models into natural
language requirement specifications with specific syntactic patterns [23, 26, 40]. Few studies pay attention to generating
requirement specifications from keywords provided by requirement analysts [52]. They fine-tune UniLM by associating
keyword knowledge and reinforcing relevancy, integrating a copy mechanism to meet the hard constraints of keywords,
and employing grammar-constrained decoding to satisfy grammatical requirements. However, end-users struggle to
possess the knowledge required to construct precise models or describe professional keywords.
This paper introduces an agile-based AI agent for generative app development through human-AI teamwork
(AgileGen). It generates acceptance criteria presented in the Gherkin language from the incomplete requirements of
end-users. The Gherkin is then translated into scenarios described in natural language for users to make decisions,
thereby clarifying end-user requirements. The code generation component produces interface designs and consistency
factors based on scenarios that have been decided upon. The consistency factors guide code generation to ensure the

        self.reactor.handle_event(event)
        self.state_machine.update_state(task, "completed")
Simulation of Human Interaction
To simulate human interaction using adversarial self-play, we'll have AI agents play both the user and the system, interacting to refine the implementation.

Steps:
Initialize Agents:

User Agent: Simulates the user, providing requirements and feedback.
System Agent: Simulates the system, implementing features and responding to feedback.
Define Interaction Protocol:

The user agent provides a requirement.
The system agent generates a solution.
The user agent evaluates the solution, providing feedback or acceptance.
Repeat the loop to refine the solution.
Implement Adversarial Self-Play:

Both agents aim to maximize their objectives.
User Agent: Wants the best possible implementation.
System Agent: Wants to satisfy the user with minimal changes.
Evolve the System:

Based on the interactions, the system agent updates its implementation strategies.
Incorporates feedback to improve future responses.
Example Interaction
Initial Requirement (User Agent):

"I want to integrate AshAI with other components, ensuring seamless task processing and state management."

System Response (System Agent):

"Implemented integration using the provided components. Here's the code snippet..."

User Feedback (User Agent):

"The state management doesn't handle edge cases. Can you ensure that tasks in invalid states are handled gracefully?"

System Update (System Agent):

"Updated the process_task method to include validation and error handling for invalid task states."

Evolution of the System
Based on the simulated interactions, the system evolves:

Improved Error Handling: Incorporates validation checks.
Enhanced Semantic Consistency: Ensures that the implementation aligns closely with user requirements.
Optimized Code Generation: Adjusts code generation strategies to produce more efficient code.
Conclusion
By integrating the tasks from your matrix with concepts from the papers, using Pydantic models generated with LLMs, and simulating human interaction through adversarial self-play, we've:

Created structured representations of tasks and their implementations.
Integrated key concepts such as human-AI teamwork, BDD practices, and model-based testing.
Simulated interactions to refine and evolve the system.
Demonstrated the evolution of the system based on feedback.
This approach allows for continuous improvement and ensures that the implementations remain aligned with user needs and the latest methodologies.

Implement the Simulations in Code: Create actual scripts to simulate the adversarial self-play interactions.
Integrate Real LLMs: Use actual language models to generate code and simulate agents.
Expand to Other Tasks: Apply this approach to all tasks in the matrix.
Validate with Real Users: Test the evolved system with actual users to gather feedback.

Introduction
This implementation creates a CLI application that models and manages documents within an Agile environment using Typer, DSPy, and Pydantic. It incorporates concepts such as:

Agile Methodologies
Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
Human-AI Teamwork
Adversarial Self-Play for simulating human interaction
We'll build a working loop that simulates interactions between a user and the system, demonstrating how the APS can be fully implemented.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install typer pydantic dspy
Typer: For building CLI applications.
Pydantic: For data validation and settings management.
DSPy: For declarative state-based programming.
Implementation Overview
Pydantic Models: Define data models for documents, states, and version control.
DSPy Integration: Use DSPy to manage state transitions and ensure semantic consistency.
Typer CLI: Create a command-line interface for interacting with the system.
Simulation Loop: Implement adversarial self-play to simulate human-computer interaction.
Pydantic Models
We'll start by defining Pydantic models for the core components.

python
Copy code
# models.py

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator
from enum import Enum
from typing import List

class DocumentState(str, Enum):
    DRAFT = 'draft'
    REVIEW = 'review'
    APPROVED = 'approved'
    IMMUTABLE = 'immutable'

class Document(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    content: str
    state: DocumentState = DocumentState.DRAFT
    version: int = 1

    @validator('state')
    def check_state(cls, value):
        if value not in DocumentState:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid state: {value}")
        return value

class VersionControl(BaseModel):
    documents: List[Document] = []

    def add_document(self, document: Document):
        self.documents.append(document)

    def get_document(self, doc_id: int) -> Document:
        for doc in self.documents:
            if doc.id == doc_id:
                return doc
        raise ValueError(f"Document with ID {doc_id} not found")

    def update_document(self, doc_id: int, content: str):
        doc = self.get_document(doc_id)
        if doc.state != DocumentState.IMMUTABLE:
            doc.content = content
            doc.version += 1
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cannot modify an immutable document")

    def change_state(self, doc_id: int, new_state: DocumentState):
        doc = self.get_document(doc_id)
        # Define valid state transitions
        valid_transitions = {
            DocumentState.DRAFT: [DocumentState.REVIEW],
            DocumentState.REVIEW: [DocumentState.APPROVED, DocumentState.DRAFT],
            DocumentState.APPROVED: [DocumentState.IMMUTABLE],
            DocumentState.IMMUTABLE: [],
        }
        if new_state in valid_transitions[doc.state]:
            doc.state = new_state
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid state transition from {doc.state} to {new_state}")
DSPy Integration
We'll use DSPy to manage state transitions and enforce rules.

python
Copy code
# state_machine.py

from dspy import Machine, State, Transition
from models import DocumentState

class DocumentStateMachine(Machine):
    draft = State('draft', initial=True)
    review = State('review')
    approved = State('approved')
    immutable = State('immutable')

    to_review = Transition(draft, review)
    to_approved = Transition(review, approved)
    to_immutable = Transition(approved, immutable)
    revert_to_draft = Transition(review, draft)

    def can_transition(self, current_state: str, new_state: str) -> bool:
        state_map = {
            'draft': self.draft,
            'review': self.review,
            'approved': self.approved,
            'immutable': self.immutable,
        }
        transition = Transition(state_map[current_state], state_map[new_state])
        return transition.is_possible()

# Instantiate the state machine
document_state_machine = DocumentStateMachine()
Typer CLI Application
Now, we'll build the CLI application using Typer.

python
Copy code
# main.py

import typer
from typing import Optional
from models import Document, VersionControl, DocumentState
from state_machine import document_state_machine

app = typer.Typer()
vc = VersionControl()

@app.command()
def add_document(name: str, content: str):
    """
    Add a new document.
    """
    doc_id = len(vc.documents) + 1
    document = Document(
        id=doc_id,
        name=name,
        content=content,
    )
    vc.add_document(document)
    typer.echo(f"Document '{name}' added with ID {doc_id} in state '{document.state}'.")

@app.command()
def update_document(doc_id: int, content: str):
    """
    Update an existing document.
    """
    try:
        vc.update_document(doc_id, content)
        typer.echo(f"Document ID {doc_id} updated.")
    except ValueError as e:
        typer.echo(f"Error: {e}")

@app.command()
def change_state(doc_id: int, new_state: str):
    """
    Change the state of a document.
    """
    try:
        doc = vc.get_document(doc_id)
        if document_state_machine.can_transition(doc.state, new_state):
            vc.change_state(doc_id, DocumentState(new_state))
            typer.echo(f"Document ID {doc_id} state changed to '{new_state}'.")
        else:
            typer.echo(f"Invalid state transition from '{doc.state}' to '{new_state}'.")
    except ValueError as e:
        typer.echo(f"Error: {e}")

@app.command()
def list_documents():
    """
    List all documents.
    """
    if not vc.documents:
        typer.echo("No documents found.")
        return
    for doc in vc.documents:
        typer.echo(f"ID: {doc.id}, Name: {doc.name}, State: {doc.state}, Version: {doc.version}")

@app.command()
def view_document(doc_id: int):
    """
    View a document's content.
    """
    try:
        doc = vc.get_document(doc_id)
        typer.echo(f"ID: {doc.id}, Name: {doc.name}, State: {doc.state}, Version: {doc.version}")
        typer.echo(f"Content:\n{doc.content}")
    except ValueError as e:
        typer.echo(f"Error: {e}")
Simulating Human Interaction
We'll implement adversarial self-play to simulate interactions between a user and the system.

python
Copy code
# simulation.py

from main import vc, document_state_machine
from models import DocumentState
import random

def simulate_interaction():
    """
    Simulate human interaction via adversarial self-play.
    """
    typer.echo("Starting simulation of human interaction via adversarial self-play.\n")

    # Add initial document
    doc_id = len(vc.documents) + 1
    document = Document(
        id=doc_id,
        name="APS Specification",
        content="Initial content.",
    )
    vc.add_document(document)
    typer.echo(f"Document '{document.name}' added with ID {doc_id}.")

    # Simulate interactions
    for iteration in range(1, 5):
        typer.echo(f"\nIteration {iteration}")

        # User provides new content
        user_input = f"Additional details added in iteration {iteration}."
        typer.echo(f"User: {user_input}")

        # System attempts to update the document
        try:
            vc.update_document(doc_id, document.content + "\n" + user_input)
            typer.echo("System: Document updated successfully.")
        except ValueError as e:
            typer.echo(f"System Error: {e}")

        # Randomly decide to change state
        if random.choice([True, False]):
            # Possible next states
            possible_states = {
                DocumentState.DRAFT: DocumentState.REVIEW,
                DocumentState.REVIEW: random.choice([DocumentState.APPROVED, DocumentState.DRAFT]),
                DocumentState.APPROVED: DocumentState.IMMUTABLE,
            }
            current_state = document.state
            if current_state in possible_states:
                new_state = possible_states[current_state]
                if document_state_machine.can_transition(current_state, new_state):
                    vc.change_state(doc_id, new_state)
                    typer.echo(f"System: Document state changed to '{new_state}'.")
                else:
                    typer.echo(f"System: Cannot transition from '{current_state}' to '{new_state}'.")
            else:
                typer.echo("System: Document is immutable; no further changes allowed.")

    typer.echo("\nSimulation complete.")
    typer.echo(f"Final Document State: {document.state}")
    typer.echo(f"Final Document Content:\n{document.content}")
Running the Application
Create an entry point to run the CLI and simulation.

python
Copy code
# run.py

import typer
from main import app
from simulation import simulate_interaction

if __name__ == "__main__":
    typer.echo("Welcome to the APS CLI Application.")
    simulate = typer.confirm("Would you like to run the simulation?")
    if simulate:
        simulate_interaction()
    else:
        app()
Conclusion
We've created a CLI application that:

Defines Pydantic models for documents and version control.
Integrates DSPy to manage state transitions and enforce business rules.
Uses Typer to create a user-friendly command-line interface.
Simulates human interaction using adversarial self-play to evolve the system.
This application aligns with the Agile Protocol Specification (APS) by:

Ensuring semantic consistency through state management.
Facilitating human-AI teamwork via simulated interactions.
Implementing BDD practices by defining state transitions and validations.
Next Steps
Extend the Simulation: Add more complex interactions and error handling.
Implement Gherkin Scenarios: Use BDD tools to define and test behaviors.
Integrate with Real LLMs: Replace simulated interactions with actual language model inputs.
Add Persistence: Store documents and states in a database or file system.
Enhance the CLI: Add more commands and features for better usability.
By fully implementing the APS with Typer, DSPy, and Pydantic, we've created a solid foundation for further development and integration of advanced features, such as AI-driven decision-making and user interactions.

5 Case Study
Our initial evaluation of the technique presented here is a case study. The objectives of this case study
were threefold:
1. Demonstrate the feasibility of the technique on a non-trivial system
2. Compare the technique to its manual alternative
3. Note any relevant observations to help form future research directions
The case study was carried out on myHealth2
, a web-based solution that has recently been developed
for the government of Malta’s Ministry of Health to provide an improved and more efficient service to
patients in the Maltese health care infrastructure. It consists of a web portal allowing access to myHealth
data for registered citizens. A back-end portal is provided so as to allow monitoring and management
to administrators. The case study was scoped to the front-end portal only, mainly because the back-end
portal was purchased off the shelf and no test scenarios were available for it. The system is able to
distinguish between doctors and citizens, providing different functionality for the two roles with Table 1
providing a list of high level functionality available to both types of users. When citizens gain access to

their myHealth Record account, they are able to search for doctors listed in the Medical Council Register,
request a specific doctor to be their trusted doctor and go on to view and manage all their personal health
data.
The case study was carried out as depicted in Figure 5. Since the system’s test scripts were not
documented in Gherkin format, they needed to be analysed and written in the required form. Once
this was done, test automation code was created such that all the scenarios became executable automated
tests. This enabled us to feed the test scenarios into our tool, create QuickCheck models and subsequently
generate and execute tests based on the models. These steps are elaborated in the following subsections.
5.1 Constructing a model for the case study
When we were granted access, the myHealth Record system had already been through testing and been
launched to the public. In this section we briefly outline the testing process used by the company that
developed myHealth. The system went through two phases of testing: the first phase was a unit testing
and integration phase which was mainly carried out by developers in the company. The second phase
consisted of user acceptance testing and was carried out in conjunction with the customer in order to
verify that the required functions had been implemented and were working correctly. The nature of the
work presented in this paper is mainly concerned with system-level or user acceptance testing, so the
second phase is of interest to us. This phase was driven by pre-documented test cases which outlined a
series of procedures and expected outcomes (see Table 2 for a sample test case).
For the purposes of this case study, the test cases from the second phase of testing were secured
and used as the basis to construct specifications in the Gherkin language. Each test case was manually
analysed and systematically converted to its equivalent Given-When-Then format. Furthermore, step
definitions were implemented such that each scenario became an executable automated test. Related test
scenarios were then grouped together and models were generated accordingly using an implementation
of Algorithm 1. Figure 6 shows one of the models generated during the exercise.
5.2 Results and Observations
With regards to exploring the feasibility of such an approach on a non-trivial system, the case study
demonstrated that this is indeed the case. We were able to generate models directly from business level
specifications and subsequently utilise those models to generate and execute test cases. The process
took approximately seven days of work to complete. This was similar to the length of time taken by
the company to carry out manual user acceptance testing of the product. However, if one looks closer
at how the time was invested (see Table 3), in the case of manual testing, the company estimates that
four days were spent designing test cases whilst three days were spent executing them. In the case of
automated model-based testing, the test design aspect was practically free (due to the use of QuickCheck)
whilst the actual execution only took one day. Whilst on the face of it, it seems that both approaches
are equally time consuming, it is worth noting that if the company had adopted the use of Cucumber

in its normal operations (as is the case with an increasing number of companies), the time require for
automated model-based testing would have been substantially reduced. Furthermore, automated modelbased testing is efficiently repeatable and will deliver consistent results when compared to that delivered
manually by human testers.
Two main observations were made throughout this process: Firstly, automated testing will not be able
to replicate all tests which are carried out manually by a human tester. In fact, we were able to replicate
74% of manual tests due to test cases which either required human judgement (e.g. checking printouts)
or were too complex to feasibly automate (e.g. temporal tests). The second observation was related to the
shrinking feature of QuickCheck: while this particular feature is fast in console-style applications, we
observed that shrinking took an inordinately long amount of time when testing web applications. This is
mainly due to the expense required to repeatedly launch a browser and navigate through a series of web
pages during the shrinking process.
It is worth noting that no new bugs were uncovered as a result of applying the technique. We think
that this is due to the fact that by the time we ran the case study, the system had been thoroughly tested,
deployed and in active use for quite some time.

# Governance and Compliance Context

The **Governance and Compliance** module within the Agile Protocol Specification (APS) provides a structured approach to ensuring all documents and processes adhere to global standards and organizational policies. It defines the governance model, outlines compliance requirements, and establishes audit trails to maintain transparency and accountability throughout the document lifecycle.

## Key Components

1. **Governance Model**: Defines the roles, responsibilities, and oversight mechanisms needed to manage and enforce compliance effectively.
2. **Compliance Requirements**: Integrates the seven most prominent global standards to ensure all documentation practices align with regulatory obligations.
3. **Audit Trails**: Provides a comprehensive log of all document actions, including creation, review, approval, and modification, to ensure full traceability.

## Prominent Global Compliance Standards

To align with international best practices, APS integrates compliance requirements from the following seven prominent global standards:

1. **ISO 27001 (Information Security Management)**: Ensures that information security controls are in place and regularly reviewed to protect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
2. **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation - EU)**: Mandates strict data protection and privacy measures for handling personal data, with a focus on transparency and user rights.
3. **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act - US)**: Requires the protection of sensitive patient health information against unauthorized access and breaches.
4. **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act - US)**: Establishes requirements for financial transparency, accuracy, and accountability in corporate governance.
5. **CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification - US DoD)**: Sets cybersecurity standards for contractors working with the U.S. Department of Defense, focusing on protecting controlled unclassified information.
6. **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology - US)**: Provides a cybersecurity framework for improving critical infrastructure security and protecting sensitive data.
7. **ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems)**: Defines criteria for a quality management system, ensuring consistent product and service quality that meets customer and regulatory requirements.

## Development Guidelines

- **Understand Compliance Requirements**: Familiarize yourself with the global standards relevant to your documentation and processes.
- **Implement Governance Processes**: Ensure all documentation follows the established governance model and complies with the identified standards.
- **Maintain Robust Audit Trails**: Use automated tools and manual checks to maintain detailed logs of all document actions and modifications.

## Business Context

The Governance and Compliance module is essential for maintaining the integrity and accountability of all documentation practices within the APS. By integrating key global standards, the module ensures that all agile processes and outputs meet regulatory requirements, organizational policies, and industry best practices.

### Key Benefits

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to international and organizational standards, reducing the risk of non-compliance.
- **Enhanced Governance**: Provides a clear framework for managing documentation, with defined roles and responsibilities.
- **Improved Transparency**: Maintains an audit trail for all document actions, enabling better oversight and accountability.

## Quality Assurance

To ensure ongoing compliance and governance integrity, the following measures are in place:

- **Periodic Audits**: Regular governance audits to assess alignment with global standards and organizational policies.
- **Automated Compliance Checks**: Use of governance automation tools to monitor and enforce compliance in real-time.

## Conclusion

The **Governance and Compliance** module is critical for ensuring that all documentation practices within the APS are aligned with global standards and organizational requirements. By maintaining a robust governance framework and adhering to compliance protocols, organizations can enhance transparency, accountability, and trust in their agile processes.

Regular reviews and updates of these protocols will help maintain compliance with evolving regulatory landscapes and organizational needs.

Introduction
The governance loop is a critical component of the Agile Protocol Specification (APS) that ensures compliance, accountability, and proper management of documents and processes within an agile framework. We'll implement this loop using:

Typer: For building a command-line interface (CLI).
DSPy: For managing state machines and state transitions.
Pydantic: For data validation and settings management.
We'll simulate human interaction using adversarial self-play, integrating concepts from the provided papers, such as:

Agile methodologies
Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
Human-AI Teamwork
Compliance with global standards
Understanding the Governance Loop
The governance loop involves:

Defining roles and responsibilities: Establishing clear roles like Author, Reviewer, Approver, and Compliance Officer.
Document lifecycle management: Managing documents through various states (Draft, Review, Approved, Immutable).
Compliance checks: Ensuring documents meet compliance standards before moving to the next state.
Audit trails: Keeping detailed logs of actions taken on documents for transparency and accountability.
Human-AI interaction: Simulating interactions between users and the system to enforce governance.
Implementation Overview
Define Pydantic Models: For users, documents, audit entries, and compliance standards.
Implement State Machines with DSPy: To manage document states and transitions.
Create Typer CLI Application: For users to interact with the system.
Simulate Human Interaction: Using scripts to simulate users performing actions.
Integrate Compliance Standards: Incorporate compliance checks during state transitions.
Defining Pydantic Models
We'll create models for:

User: Represents a user with a role.
Document: Represents a document with state, version, etc.
AuditEntry: Logs actions performed on documents.
ComplianceStandard: Represents compliance requirements.

Simulating Human Interaction
We'll simulate users interacting with the system using a script.

python
Copy code
# simulate.py

    run_command('change-state 1 submit_for_review')

    # Approver logs in
    run_command('login Carol approver')
    # Approver approves
    run_command('change-state 1 approve')

    # Compliance officer logs in

    # View audit trail
    run_command('view-audit-trail')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_governance_loop()
Integrating Compliance Standards
We'll simulate compliance checks during the finalization step.

python
Copy code
# governance.py (Add to Governance class)

def check_compliance(self, document: Document) -> bool:
    # Simulate compliance checks
    # In a real implementation, this would involve checking the document against compliance requirements
    # For this example, we'll assume all documents pass compliance
    self.log_action(
        user=User(user_id=0, name="Compliance System", role=Role.COMPLIANCE_OFFICER),
        action='compliance_check',
        doc_id=document.doc_id,
        details="Compliance check passed."
    )
    return True
Running the Application
Ensure you have the following files:

models.py

Conclusion
We've successfully created a governance loop for the APS using:

Pydantic: For defining data models with validation.
DSPy: For managing state machines and transitions.
Typer: For creating a CLI application.
Simulated Human Interaction: Using a script to perform actions.
This implementation:

Enforces roles and responsibilities: Users can only perform actions permitted by their roles.
Manages document lifecycle: Documents transition through states with proper checks.
Maintains an audit trail: All actions are logged for accountability.
Integrates compliance checks: Ensures documents meet standards before finalization.
Next Steps
Expand Compliance Checks: Integrate real compliance standards and check documents accordingly.
Persistent Storage: Use a database to store data instead of in-memory structures.
Authentication and Security: Implement user authentication mechanisms.
User Interface: Develop a web or desktop application for better usability.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests to ensure system reliability.
Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
By implementing the governance loop, we've aligned the system with the Governance and Compliance module of the APS, ensuring proper management, compliance adherence, and accountability within the agile framework.

# File Directory Structure Context

The file directory structure for the **Agile Protocol Specification (APS)** is designed to provide a clear, organized, and efficient way to manage all project documents, whether they follow traditional agile practices or **Adversarial Agile Processes (AAP)**. This structure integrates all documents into a unified system, where both standard and adversarial roles and practices are represented.

## Architecture Overview

### Top-Level Directories

The directory structure is organized by **document states**, each representing a phase in the document lifecycle. These directories are:

1. **drafts/**: Contains all documents in the Draft state. These documents are actively being created or edited and are not yet finalized.
2. **in-review/**: Stores documents that are under review by stakeholders or subject matter experts. These documents require validation and feedback.
3. **provisionals/**: Holds documents that are in a stable form but may still be subject to minor adjustments before final acceptance.
4. **accepted/**: Includes all documents that have been reviewed, approved, and accepted for the current cycle. These documents are considered final for their purpose.
5. **final/**: Contains documents that are fully finalized and no longer open to modifications, except through new versioning.

### Subdirectories by Value Stream and Document Type

Each state directory contains subdirectories for different **value streams** and **document types**:

- **Value Streams**:
  - product-development/
  - customer-support/
  - (Other value streams as necessary)

- **Document Types**:
  - context/
  - metrics/
  - pathway/
  - (Other types as relevant to the APS)

### Configuration Files

A dedicated **config/** directory under the current/ directory stores configuration files that define the settings and specifications for agile practices:

- ProductDevelopment_AgileSpec_APM_v5.234.9.yaml
- CustomerSupport_PathwayConfig_APM_v3.4_Accepted_2024-09-10_ADoe.yaml

### Historical Archives

The **archives/** directory holds older or deprecated documents that are no longer actively used but preserved for reference. Documents are organized by year, and each year contains subdirectories with archived files.

## Naming Conventions and Metadata

### File Naming Format

- Files must follow the standardized naming format:  
  <ProjectArea>_<DocumentType>_<Role>_<Version>_<State>_<Date>_<Author>.<extension>

- **Example**:
  - ProductDevelopment_Context_AF_v2024-09_Draft_2024-09-01_JSmith.md

### Metadata Requirements

- Each file must include detailed metadata headers using YAML or JSON to provide context and ensure consistency. These headers should specify the document title, version, state, author, and other relevant information.

## Rationale for the Unified Directory Structure

1. **Clarity and Accessibility**: Organizing files by state and value stream provides immediate clarity about their status and purpose, reducing time spent searching for documents.
2. **Flexibility**: A unified structure supports both traditional agile practices and AAP within the same framework, allowing teams to adapt dynamically to changing project needs.
3. **Enhanced Governance**: Clear organization supports better governance, compliance, and auditability by maintaining transparent records of document states and transitions.
4. **Efficient Integration**: Simplifies the integration of AI tools and automation scripts by providing a predictable and consistent file structure.

## Best Practices

- Ensure all new files are placed in the correct directory according to their current state.
- Follow the metadata-rich naming conventions strictly to maintain consistency.
- Regularly review and update the context files as documents transition between states to reflect their current status accurately.

## Conclusion

This context defines a unified and structured approach to managing all documents within the **APS** framework, supporting both human and AI contributors in agile environments. By adhering to these guidelines, teams can maintain a well-organized repository that enhances collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement.

Introduction
We aim to create a DSPy file generator loop that automates the creation and organization of files according to the APS directory structure, simulating the SAFe equivalent for the PLAN Pro loop. This will help in:

Automating the creation of context files, configuration files, and other documentation.
Ensuring compliance with the governance and file structure standards.
Simulating an agile planning process within the APS framework.
We'll use:

DSPy: For declarative state machine programming and process control.
Pydantic: For data validation and model definitions.
Typer: For building a command-line interface (CLI) application.
Understanding the Requirements
SAFe Equivalent for PLAN Pro Loop: In SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework), planning is a crucial process. The Program Increment (PI) Planning is a recurring, cadence-based, face-to-face event that serves as the heartbeat of the Agile Release Train (ART), aligning all teams on the ART to a shared mission and vision.

PLAN Pro Loop: Assuming this refers to a planning process loop within your organization or framework.

Objective: Implement a file generator loop that simulates this planning process, automating the creation of necessary documents and organizing them according to the APS file directory structure.

Implementation Overview
Define Pydantic Models: For projects, documents, and configurations.

Implement DSPy State Machine: To model the planning process loop, including states like planning, execution, review, and adaptation.

Create Typer CLI Application: To interact with the system, trigger file generation, and manage the process.

Integrate with File Directory Structure: Ensure files are created and organized according to the directory structure specified in the File Directory Structure Context module.

Simulate SAFe Planning Loop: Use the state machine to simulate iterations of the planning process.

Defining Pydantic Models
python
Copy code
# models.py

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from enum import Enum
from typing import List, Optional
from datetime import datetime

class DocumentType(str, Enum):
    CONTEXT = 'context'
    CONFIG = 'config'
    METRICS = 'metrics'
    PATHWAY = 'pathway'

        filename = f"{self.project_area.value}_{self.document_type.value}_{self.role}_v{self.version}_{self.state}_{date_str}_{self.author.replace(' ', '')}.md"
        return filename

    def filepath(self) -> str:
        path = f"{self.state.value}/{self.project_area.value}/{self.document_type.value}/"
        return path
Implementing the DSPy File Generator Loop
We'll define a state machine using DSPy to model the planning loop.

python
Copy code
# plan_pro_loop.py

from dspy import Machine, State, Transition
from typing import Callable

class PlanProLoop(Machine):
    # States
    planning = State('planning', initial=True)
    execution = State('execution')
    review = State('review')
    adaptation = State('adaptation')

    # Transitions
    start_execution = Transition(planning, execution)
    complete_execution = Transition(execution, review)
    perform_review = Transition(review, adaptation)
    adapt_plan = Transition(adaptation, planning)

    # Actions
    def on_start_execution(self):
        print("Transitioning to Execution phase.")
        self.generate_documents('execution')

    def on_complete_execution(self):
        print("Transitioning to Review phase.")
        self.generate_documents('review')

    def on_perform_review(self):
        print("Transitioning to Adaptation phase.")
        self.generate_documents('adaptation')

    def on_adapt_plan(self):
        print("Transitioning back to Planning phase.")
        self.generate_documents('planning')

    # Document generation logic
    def generate_documents(self, phase: str):
        # Implement logic to generate documents for the given phase
        if self.generator_callback:
            self.generator_callback(phase)

    # Set a callback for document generation
    def set_generator_callback(self, callback: Callable[[str], None]):
        self.generator_callback = callback

    # Initialize
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.generator_callback = None
Creating the Typer CLI Application
python
Copy code
# main.py

import typer
from plan_pro_loop import PlanProLoop
from models import Document, DocumentState, DocumentType, ProjectArea
from datetime import datetime
import os

app = typer.Typer()
plan_loop = PlanProLoop()

# Directory structure setup
def ensure_directories_exist():
    states = [state.value for state in DocumentState]
    for state in states:
        for project_area in ProjectArea:
            for doc_type in DocumentType:
                path = os.path.join(state, project_area.value, doc_type.value)
                os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)

# Document generator callback
def generate_documents(phase: str):
    print(f"Generating documents for phase: {phase}")
    # Example: Generate a context document in the drafts state
    doc = Document(
        project_area=ProjectArea.PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT,
        document_type=DocumentType.CONTEXT,
        role='AF',  # Agile Facilitator
        version='1.0.0',
        state=DocumentState.DRAFT,
        date=datetime.now(),
        author='Jane Doe',
        content=f"# {phase.capitalize()} Phase Document\n\nGenerated during {phase} phase."
    )
    filepath = os.path.join(doc.filepath(), doc.filename())
    with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
        f.write(doc.content)
    print(f"Document generated at: {filepath}")

# Set the generator callback
plan_loop.set_generator_callback(generate_documents)

@app.command()
def run_loop(iterations: int = typer.Option(1, help="Number of iterations to run the loop")):
    """
    Run the PLAN Pro loop for a specified number of iterations.
    """
    ensure_directories_exist()
    for i in range(iterations):
        print(f"\n--- Iteration {i+1} ---")
        plan_loop.start_execution()
        plan_loop.complete_execution()
        plan_loop.perform_review()
        plan_loop.adapt_plan()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
Integrating with the File Directory Structure
The ensure_directories_exist() function ensures that the directory structure specified in your File Directory Structure Context is created before generating documents.

States: drafts/, in-review/, provisionals/, accepted/, final/
Project Areas: product-development/, customer-support/, etc.
Document Types: context/, config/, metrics/, pathway/
The generate_documents() function creates documents and places them in the correct directory based on their state and other metadata.

Simulating SAFe Equivalent PLAN Pro Loop
By running the run_loop command, we simulate the planning process:

Planning Phase: Generates planning documents.
Execution Phase: Simulates work being done.
Review Phase: Generates review documents.
Adaptation Phase: Adjusts plans based on feedback.
This loop can be run multiple times to simulate multiple iterations or Program Increments (PIs) in SAFe.

# Naming Conventions Context

The **Naming Conventions** within the **Agile Protocol Specification (APS)** provide a structured approach to file and directory naming. These conventions are designed to ensure that every filename communicates essential metadata clearly and concisely, supporting both human understanding and machine readability. Consistent naming standards facilitate efficient document management, retrieval, and integration with AI tools.

## Purpose

1. **Immediate Identification**: Ensure that filenames provide sufficient metadata to identify the content, version, state, author, and context of each file at a glance.
2. **Consistency**: Standardize naming across the APS framework to avoid ambiguity and confusion, ensuring all team members and AI tools use the same conventions.
3. **Machine Readability**: Integrate metadata into filenames to enhance compatibility with AI tools, scripts, and automation processes.
4. **Traceability and Compliance**: Maintain a clear record of document evolution, supporting governance and compliance requirements through standardized filenames.

## Key Components of Naming Conventions

### 1. **Metadata-Rich Filenames**

- **Format**: Filenames must follow a standardized format that includes key metadata elements to provide clear and immediate context.  
- **Standard Format**: <Component>_<Type>_<State>_<Role>_<Date>_<Version>_<Author>.<Extension>
  - **Component**: Indicates the part of the project (e.g., ProductDevelopment, CustomerSupport).
  - **Type**: Describes the document type (e.g., Context, KanbanBoard, SprintBacklog).
  - **State**: Specifies the current state of the document (e.g., Draft, InReview, Accepted).
  - **Role**: Defines the adversarial or non-adversarial role involved (e.g., APM for Adversarial Product Management, AT for Adversarial Testing).
  - **Date**: Uses YYYY-MM-DD format for the creation or last modification date.
  - **Version**: Follows the versioning strategy outlined in the APS (e.g., v1.0.0).
  - **Author**: Includes the initials or username of the document creator or owner.
  - **Extension**: Indicates the file format (e.g., md, yaml, json).

### 2. **Directory Naming**

- **Purpose**: Directories should use clear and descriptive names to reflect their content and purpose, aligning with the file naming conventions.
- **Standard Format**: <Category>-<Purpose>-<Date>  
  - **Category**: Describes the broad category of the directory (e.g., drafts, in-review, accepted).
  - **Purpose**: Specifies the focus or primary content of the directory (e.g., Pathway, Metrics).
  - **Date**: Optional, but useful for archiving directories by the relevant time period.

### 3. **Validation Tools for Enforcing Naming Standards**

- **Custom Scripts**: Scripts to automatically check that filenames and directories conform to the specified naming conventions.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Naming validation tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to enforce standards during development and deployment.

## Best Practices for Naming Files and Directories

1. **Consistency**: Always adhere to the naming conventions specified in this context document to maintain consistency across the APS framework.
2. **Clarity**: Use descriptive names that clearly convey the purpose and content of the document or directory.
3. **Brevity**: Keep filenames concise while including all necessary metadata elements. Avoid overly long names that may be truncated or difficult to read.
4. **Automation-Friendly**: Use standardized formats to facilitate parsing and integration with automation tools and AI systems.
5. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review naming conventions to ensure they remain relevant and aligned with evolving APS practices.

## Rationale for Naming Standards

1. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Clear, metadata-rich filenames and directories support effective communication among team members and AI tools.
2. **Improved Governance**: Standardized names contribute to better governance and compliance management by ensuring all documents are easily identifiable and traceable.
3. **Streamlined Automation**: Consistent naming conventions make it easier to automate processes, reducing manual overhead and the risk of errors.
4. **Scalable and Flexible**: The naming conventions are designed to accommodate future growth and changes, maintaining a structured approach even as the project evolves.

## Conclusion

The **Naming Conventions** within APS are integral to creating a cohesive and efficient document management system. By embedding essential metadata directly into filenames and directories, the conventions ensure that all APS documents are clearly identifiable, consistent, and machine-readable, facilitating both human and AI collaboration.

Adhering to these standards will enhance document retrieval, version control, and integration across agile processes, supporting continuous improvement and agile excellence.

Integrating Naming Conventions and Metadata Handling
We've ensured that:

Filenames and directories are generated according to the Naming Conventions Context.
Metadata is embedded directly into filenames, including component, type, state, role, date, version, and author.
Validation tools are implemented to enforce naming conventions, raising errors if a filename does not comply.
Advanced Validation and Compliance Checks
Filename Validation: Uses regular expressions to validate filenames against the naming conventions.
Directory Structure Validation: Ensures directories are created and organized according to the specified structure.
Compliance Checks: Simulates governance and compliance validation during state transitions.
Simulating AI-Assisted Content Generation
The ai_generate_content() function simulates AI-generated content for documents, enhancing realism.
This demonstrates integration with AI tools, as specified in the Naming Conventions Context and Governance and Compliance modules.
AI content includes appropriate headings and context based on the phase and document type.

"""The BaseInhabitant Module for Reactive Domain-Driven Design (RDDDY) Framework
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This module implements the core Inhabitant abstraction within the RDDDY framework, providing a robust foundation for building reactive, domain-driven systems that are scalable, maintainable, and capable of handling complex, concurrent interactions. The Inhabitant model encapsulates both state and behavior, allowing for asynchronous message passing as the primary means of communication between inhabitants, thus fostering loose coupling and enhanced system resilience.

### Overview

Inhabitants are the fundamental units of computation in the RDDDY framework. Each inhabitant possesses a unique identity, a mailbox for message queuing, and a set of behaviors to handle incoming messages. The Inhabitant module facilitates the creation, supervision, and coordination of inhabitants within an ServiceColony, ensuring that messages are delivered and processed in a manner consistent with the system's domain-driven design principles.

### Multiline Calculus for Inhabitant Behavior Specification

The operational semantics of inhabitants within the RDDDY framework are formalized through a rigorous multiline calculus, which outlines the preconditions, postconditions, and invariants that govern inhabitant behavior and interaction. This calculus serves as a contract, ensuring that inhabitants behave correctly and predictably within their designated domain contexts.

#### Inhabitant State Transition

Given an inhabitant \(A\) with state \(s\) and a message \(m\), the state transition is defined as:

Precondition ( Pre Pre): 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 s∈S and 𝑚 ∈ 𝑀 m∈M
Transition: 𝑇 ( 𝑠 , 𝑚 ) → 𝑠 ′ T(s,m)→s ′
Postcondition ( Post Post): 𝑠 ′ ∈ 𝑆 ′ s ′ ∈S ′

#### Message Handling

For a message \(m\) handled by the inhabitant, leading to a state modification:

Precondition ( Pre Pre): 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 s∈S and 𝑚 ∈ 𝑀 m∈M
Handling: 𝐻 ( 𝑚 , 𝑠 ) → 𝑠 ′ ′ H(m,s)→s ′′
Postcondition ( Post Post): 𝑠 ′ ′ ∈ 𝑆 ′ ′ s ′′ ∈S ′′

#### Invariant Maintenance

Ensuring system invariants \(I\) across transitions:

Invariant: 𝐼 ( 𝑆 ) ∧ 𝑇 ( 𝑠 , 𝑚 ) → 𝑠 ′ ⇒ 𝐼 ( 𝑆 ′ ) I(S)∧T(s,m)→s ′ ⇒I(S ′ )

#### Domain-Specific Assertions

Linking inhabitant state transitions to domain logic:

Precondition ( Pre Pre): Δ ( 𝑠 ) Δ(s) and 𝛿 ( 𝑚 ) δ(m)
Domain Logic: 𝐷 ( 𝑠 , 𝑚 ) → Δ ( 𝑠 ′ ) D(s,m)→Δ(s ′ )
Postcondition ( Post Post): Δ ′ ( 𝑠 ′ ) Δ ′ (s ′ )

### Purpose

This calculus not only specifies the expected behavior of inhabitants in response to messages but also integrates domain-specific knowledge, ensuring that inhabitants operate in alignment with the broader domain-driven objectives of the system. By adhering to these specifications, the Inhabitant module provides a reliable and expressive framework for developing systems that are both technically sound and closely aligned with domain requirements.

### Usage

Developers should implement inhabitant behaviors in accordance with the outlined calculus, ensuring that each inhabitant's implementation respects the preconditions, postconditions, and domain-specific assertions relevant to their system's domain logic. This approach facilitates the development of systems that are not only functionally correct but also domain-compliant, thereby enhancing the value and applicability of the RDDDY framework in real-world scenarios.

Create *APSAdversary based on ChallengerSalesAgent for each APS Role
ChatGPT

Thought for 36 seconds

Certainly! Below are the implementations of *APSAdversary classes based on the ChallengerSalesAgent for each APS role. Each class represents an adversarial agent for a specific role in the Agile Protocol Specification (APS) framework, using finite state machines (FSM) to model their behaviors and processes.

We'll define the following APS roles:

Adversarial Product Manager (APMAPSAdversary)
Adversarial Tester (ATAPSAdversary)
Agile Facilitator (AFAPSAdversary)
Adversarial Developer (ADAPSAdversary)
Adversarial Scrum Master (ASMAPSAdversary)
These classes inherit from FSMMixin and BaseInhabitant, similar to the ChallengerSalesAgent, and define states and transitions relevant to each role.

Common Imports and Base Classes
First, we'll import the necessary modules and define any base classes or mixins if they are not already defined.

    print("Initial state:", apm_adversary.state)

    # Simulate the adversary's actions
    apm_adversary.start_gathering_requirements()
    print("State after gathering requirements:", apm_adversary.state)

    apm_adversary.prioritize_backlog()
    print("State after prioritizing backlog:", apm_adversary.state)

    apm_adversary.refine_stories()
    print("State after refining stories:", apm_adversary.state)

    apm_adversary.plan_sprint()
    print("State after planning sprint:", apm_adversary.state)

    apm_adversary.review_progress()
    print("State after reviewing progress:", apm_adversary.state)

    apm_adversary.accept_stories()
    print("State after accepting stories:", apm_adversary.state)

    apm_adversary.complete_cycle()
    print("State after completing cycle:", apm_adversary.state)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Explanation
States and Transitions: Each adversary class defines an enumeration of states (Enum) relevant to the role and methods decorated with @trigger to define transitions between states.

FSM Initialization: In the constructor (__init__), we initialize the FSM using self.setup_fsm, specifying the state enumeration and the initial state.

Triggers: The @trigger decorator specifies the source state(s) and the destination state for each method, effectively defining the FSM's transitions.

Actions: Inside each method, we implement the action that occurs during the transition, such as printing a message to simulate the activity.

Prompt Method: The prompt method allows the agent to respond to prompts, potentially integrating with AI modules or handling specific logic. Here, we print a response indicating the agent's reaction to the prompt.

Additional Triggers: We include additional triggers to handle loops and branching, allowing the FSM to model more complex behaviors and transitions that may occur in real-world scenarios.

By creating these *APSAdversary classes for each APS role, we model the adversarial aspects of the Agile roles within the APS framework, providing a foundation for simulating interactions, testing processes, and integrating AI-assisted functionalities.

Feel free to integrate these classes into your existing codebase, adjust the states and transitions to match your specific processes, and enhance the prompt methods to incorporate more advanced behaviors or AI integrations.

Have the agents use different models to save files and loop
ChatGPT

Thought for 8 seconds

Certainly! Let's enhance the agents so that they use different models to process prompts, save files, and loop through their tasks. We'll:

Modify the agents to use different AI models when handling prompts.
Integrate the predict_types function or a similar mechanism to perform predictions.
Implement file saving functionality within the agents.
Create a loop where agents continuously process tasks.
Overview
Agents: Each agent (*APSAdversary) will use a different AI model to process prompts.
Models: We'll simulate different models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4) for each agent.
File Saving: Agents will save their outputs to files, following the naming conventions.
Looping: Agents will loop through their FSM states, processing prompts at each state.
Steps
Update the Agents to Use Different Models: Modify the prompt method in each agent class to use a specific model.

Implement the predict_type Function: Define a function that simulates predictions using the specified model.

Integrate File Saving: Within the prompt method, add functionality to save the agent's outputs to files.

Create a Loop for Agents: Implement a loop where agents process prompts and transition through states.

1. Update the Agents to Use Different Models
We'll modify the prompt method in each agent class to use a specific model. For simplicity, we'll simulate models by passing a model name.

Example Agent Modification
Let's modify the APMAPSAdversary class as an example.

python
Copy code
class APMAPSAdversary(FSMMixin, BaseInhabitant):
    def __init__(self, model_name='gpt-3'):
        super().__init__()
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.setup_fsm(state_enum=APMState, initial=APMState.INITIALIZING)

    # Existing methods...

    def prompt(self, prompt_text, **kwargs):
        super().prompt(prompt_text, **kwargs)
        # Use the specified model for prediction
        prediction = predict_type(prompt_text, self.model_name)
        print(f"APM ({self.model_name}) responding to prompt: {prediction}")
        # Save the output to a file
        self.save_output(prediction, prompt_text)
We added:

model_name parameter: Allows each agent to use a specific model.
Modified prompt method: Uses predict_type with the agent's model.
save_output method: We'll define this to save outputs to files.
2. Implement the predict_type Function
We'll define a predict_type function that simulates model predictions.

python
Copy code
def predict_type(input_text: str, model_name: str) -> str:
    """
    Simulates a prediction using the specified model.

    Args:
        input_text (str): The input text for the model.
        model_name (str): The name of the model to use.

    Returns:
        str: The predicted output.
    """
    # Simulate different models by appending the model name
    return f"[{model_name}] Predicted response to '{input_text}'"
3. Integrate File Saving
Add a save_output method in the agent class to save outputs.

python
Copy code
class APMAPSAdversary(FSMMixin, BaseInhabitant):
    # Existing code...

    def save_output(self, prediction: str, prompt_text: str):
        # Generate a filename based on agent's state and prompt
        filename = f"{self.__class__.__name__}_{self.state}_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}.txt"
        filepath = os.path.join('outputs', filename)
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(filepath), exist_ok=True)
        with open(filepath, 'w') as file:
            file.write(f"Prompt: {prompt_text}\n")
            file.write(f"Response: {prediction}\n")
        print(f"Output saved to {filepath}")
save_output method: Saves the prompt and prediction to a file in the outputs directory.
4. Create a Loop for Agents
We'll create a loop where agents process prompts and transition through states.

Example Main Function
python
Copy code
def main():
    # Initialize agents with different models
    apm_agent = APMAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-3')
    at_agent = ATAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-3.5')
    af_agent = AFAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-4')

    agents = [apm_agent, at_agent, af_agent]

    # Simulate prompts for each agent
    prompts = [
        "Start your initial task.",
        "Proceed to the next step.",
        "Handle any issues.",
        "Finalize your work."
    ]

    for agent in agents:
        print(f"\n--- Running agent: {agent.__class__.__name__} ---")
        for prompt_text in prompts:
            agent.prompt(prompt_text)
            # Transition to the next state
            possible_triggers = agent.possible_triggers()
            if possible_triggers:
                # Invoke the next trigger
                getattr(agent, possible_triggers[0])()
                print(f"State after transition: {agent.state}")
            else:
                print("No further transitions available.")
                break  # Exit the loop if no transitions are available
Agents Initialization: Each agent is initialized with a different model.
Processing Prompts: Agents process prompts and save outputs.
State Transitions: Agents transition through their FSM states.
Full Implementation
1. Modify Agent Classes
We'll modify all agent classes to include the model_name, prompt, and save_output methods.

Example for ATAPSAdversary
python
Copy code
class ATAPSAdversary(FSMMixin, BaseInhabitant):
    def __init__(self, model_name='gpt-3.5'):
        super().__init__()
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.setup_fsm(state_enum=ATState, initial=ATState.INITIALIZING)

    # Existing methods...

    def prompt(self, prompt_text, **kwargs):
        super().prompt(prompt_text, **kwargs)
        prediction = predict_type(prompt_text, self.model_name)
        print(f"AT ({self.model_name}) responding to prompt: {prediction}")
        self.save_output(prediction, prompt_text)

    def save_output(self, prediction: str, prompt_text: str):
        filename = f"{self.__class__.__name__}_{self.state}_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}.txt"
        filepath = os.path.join('outputs', filename)
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(filepath), exist_ok=True)
        with open(filepath, 'w') as file:
            file.write(f"Prompt: {prompt_text}\n")
            file.write(f"Response: {prediction}\n")
        print(f"Output saved to {filepath}")
Repeat similar modifications for other agent classes (AFAPSAdversary, ADAPSAdversary, ASMAPSAdversary).

2. Update predict_types Function (Optional)
If you want to use the predict_types function as in the provided code, you can integrate it into the agents. However, since our agents are handling their own predictions, it may not be necessary.

Running the Agents
Here's the complete code for running the agents.

python
Copy code
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Assume all necessary imports and agent classes are defined above

def predict_type(input_text: str, model_name: str) -> str:
    # Simulate different models
    return f"[{model_name}] Predicted response to '{input_text}'"

def main():
    # Initialize agents with different models
    apm_agent = APMAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-3')
    at_agent = ATAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-3.5')
    af_agent = AFAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-4')

    agents = [apm_agent, at_agent, af_agent]

    # Simulate prompts for each agent
    prompts = [
        "Start your initial task.",
        "Proceed to the next step.",
        "Handle any issues.",
        "Finalize your work."
    ]

    for agent in agents:
        print(f"\n--- Running agent: {agent.__class__.__name__} ---")
        for prompt_text in prompts:
            agent.prompt(prompt_text)
            # Transition to the next state
            possible_triggers = agent.possible_triggers()
            if possible_triggers:
                # Invoke the next trigger
                getattr(agent, possible_triggers[0])()
                print(f"State after transition: {agent.state}")
            else:
                print("No further transitions available.")
                break  # Exit the loop if no transitions are available

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Output Example
Running the script will produce output similar to:

vbnet
Copy code
--- Running agent: APMAPSAdversary ---
APM (gpt-3) responding to prompt: [gpt-3] Predicted response to 'Start your initial task.'
Output saved to outputs/APMAPSAdversary_APMState.INITIALIZING_20231005153000.txt
APM: Starting to gather requirements from stakeholders.
State after transition: APMState.GATHERING_REQUIREMENTS
APM (gpt-3) responding to prompt: [gpt-3] Predicted response to 'Proceed to the next step.'
Output saved to outputs/APMAPSAdversary_APMState.GATHERING_REQUIREMENTS_20231005153001.txt
APM: Prioritizing the product backlog based on gathered requirements.
State after transition: APMState.PRIORITIZING_BACKLOG
# ... and so on for each agent and prompt
Files will be saved in the outputs directory with names like:

APMAPSAdversary_APMState.INITIALIZING_20231005153000.txt
ATAPSAdversary_ATState.INITIALIZING_20231005153002.txt
AFAPSAdversary_AFState.INITIALIZING_20231005153004.txt
Explanation
Different Models: Each agent uses a different model specified by model_name.
Saving Files: Agents save their outputs to files with names that include the class name, state, and timestamp.
Looping: Agents loop through prompts and transition through their FSM states.
Possible Triggers: The possible_triggers method retrieves available transitions from the current state.
Conclusion
By modifying the agent classes to use different models, save outputs to files, and loop through their tasks, we've enhanced the agents' functionality as requested. Each agent now:

Uses a specific AI model to process prompts.
Saves the outputs to files with metadata-rich filenames.
Loops through FSM states, processing prompts and performing state transitions.
This setup allows for simulating agents with different behaviors and capabilities, integrating AI models, and maintaining records of their interactions.

Next Steps
Integrate Real AI Models: Replace the simulated predict_type function with actual AI model integrations (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3/4 APIs).
Enhance File Naming: Incorporate more metadata into filenames, following your naming conventions.
Implement Error Handling: Add error handling for cases where transitions are not possible.
Expand Agent Interactions: Allow agents to interact with each other, exchanging messages and influencing state transitions.
Persist Agent State: Save agent states between runs for continuity.

Thought for 6 seconds

Certainly! Let's simulate a full Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) cycle using the adversarial agents we previously defined. We'll have the agents interact through the filesystem and exchange messages to coordinate their activities, mimicking a real-world SAFe environment.

Introduction
In this simulation, we'll:

Simulate a full SAFe cycle using the adversarial agents (*APSAdversary classes).
Enable agents to interact through the filesystem and message passing.
Model the interactions and workflows of different roles in a SAFe environment.
Understanding the SAFe Cycle
SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) is a set of organizational and workflow patterns intended to guide enterprises in scaling lean and agile practices. Key components include:

Program Increment (PI) Planning: A cadence-based, face-to-face event that serves as the heartbeat of the Agile Release Train (ART), aligning all teams to a shared mission and vision.

Roles and Responsibilities:

Product Manager (APM): Defines and prioritizes the product backlog.
Scrum Master (ASM): Facilitates the agile process and removes impediments.
Developers (AD): Build and deliver the product increments.
Testers (AT): Ensure product quality through testing.
Agile Facilitator (AF): Coaches the team and promotes agile practices.
Artifacts and Processes:

Backlog Items: User stories, features, and enablers.
Sprint Planning: Teams plan their work for the upcoming sprint.
Daily Stand-ups: Short meetings to synchronize activities.
Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives: Assess progress and improve processes.
Agents and Their Roles
We'll use the previously defined agents:

APMAPSAdversary: Adversarial Product Manager.
ASMAPSAdversary: Adversarial Scrum Master.
ADAPSAdversary: Adversarial Developer.
ATAPSAdversary: Adversarial Tester.
AFAPSAdversary: Agile Facilitator.
Implementation Overview
Enhance Agents: Modify agents to support message passing and file-based interactions.

Implement Message Passing: Use a message bus or simple in-memory queue for agents to send and receive messages.

Filesystem Interactions: Agents read from and write to files to share artifacts like user stories, test reports, etc.

Simulate SAFe Cycle:

Agents perform actions according to their roles.
Agents communicate to coordinate activities.
Agents update the filesystem to reflect the progress.
Run the Simulation: Execute the agents in a loop to simulate multiple iterations.

Enhancing Agents for Interaction
We'll enhance agents to:

Send and receive messages: Implement a messaging mechanism.

Interact with the filesystem: Read/write files to share artifacts.

Maintain state: Keep track of their own state and react accordingly.

Message Class
First, let's define a simple Message class.

python
Copy code
# message.py

class Message:
    def __init__(self, sender, receiver, content):
        self.sender = sender  # Agent sending the message
        self.receiver = receiver  # Agent receiving the message
        self.content = content  # Message content
Message Bus
We'll implement a simple message bus to handle message passing.

python
Copy code
# message_bus.py

class MessageBus:
    def __init__(self):
        self.messages = []

    def send(self, message):
        self.messages.append(message)

    def receive(self, receiver):
        received_messages = [m for m in self.messages if m.receiver == receiver]
        # Remove the messages that have been received
        self.messages = [m for m in self.messages if m.receiver != receiver]
        return received_messages
Implementing Message Passing
We'll modify agents to:

Include a reference to the message bus.

Implement methods to send and receive messages.

Process incoming messages.

Modifying the Agent Base Class
Let's create a base class that includes messaging capabilities.

python
Copy code
# agent_base.py

from datetime import datetime
import os

class AgentBase(FSMMixin, BaseInhabitant):
    def __init__(self, name, model_name, message_bus):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.message_bus = message_bus

    def send_message(self, receiver, content):
        message = Message(sender=self.name, receiver=receiver, content=content)
        self.message_bus.send(message)
        print(f"{self.name} sent message to {receiver}: {content}")

    def receive_messages(self):
        messages = self.message_bus.receive(self.name)
        for message in messages:
            self.process_message(message)

    def process_message(self, message):
        print(f"{self.name} received message from {message.sender}: {message.content}")
        # Implement message-specific processing in subclasses

    def save_output(self, filename, content):
        filepath = os.path.join('outputs', filename)
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(filepath), exist_ok=True)
        with open(filepath, 'w') as file:
            file.write(content)
        print(f"{self.name} saved output to {filepath}")

    def prompt(self, prompt_text, **kwargs):
        super().prompt(prompt_text, **kwargs)
        prediction = predict_type(prompt_text, self.model_name)
        print(f"{self.name} ({self.model_name}) responding to prompt: {prediction}")
        # Save the output to a file
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
        filename = f"{self.name}_{self.state}_{timestamp}.txt"
        content = f"Prompt: {prompt_text}\nResponse: {prediction}\n"
        self.save_output(filename, content)
Updating Agents to Inherit from AgentBase
We'll update each agent to inherit from AgentBase and implement process_message.

Example: APMAPSAdversary
python
Copy code
class APMAPSAdversary(AgentBase):
    def __init__(self, model_name, message_bus):
        super().__init__(name='APM', model_name=model_name, message_bus=message_bus)
        self.setup_fsm(state_enum=APMState, initial=APMState.INITIALIZING)

    # Existing methods...

    def process_message(self, message):
        super().process_message(message)
        # Process the message content
        if "requirement" in message.content:
            # Maybe update requirements or backlog
            print(f"{self.name} is updating requirements based on message.")
Repeat similar updates for other agents.

Simulating the SAFe Cycle
Simulation Steps
Initialize the Message Bus.

Create Agents: Instantiate agents with the message bus.

Initialize Shared Files: Create initial artifacts like the product backlog.

Run Simulation Loop:

Agents perform actions according to their FSMs.
Agents send messages to coordinate (e.g., APM sends requirements to AD).
Agents read/write files (e.g., AD reads user stories, AT writes test reports).
Agents process incoming messages.
Agents transition to next states.
Repeat the loop for multiple iterations to simulate sprints.

Implementing the Simulation Loop
python
Copy code
def main():
    # Initialize the message bus
    message_bus = MessageBus()

    # Initialize agents with the message bus
    apm_agent = APMAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-3', message_bus=message_bus)
    at_agent = ATAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-3.5', message_bus=message_bus)
    af_agent = AFAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-4', message_bus=message_bus)
    ad_agent = ADAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-3', message_bus=message_bus)
    asm_agent = ASMAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-3.5', message_bus=message_bus)

    agents = [apm_agent, at_agent, af_agent, ad_agent, asm_agent]

    # Initialize shared files (e.g., product backlog)
    initial_backlog = "Initial Product Backlog:\n- Feature A\n- Feature B\n"
    with open('shared/product_backlog.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write(initial_backlog)

    # Simulation loop
    for sprint in range(1, 3):  # Simulate 2 sprints
        print(f"\n=== Sprint {sprint} ===")
        for day in range(1, 6):  # Simulate 5-day sprints
            print(f"\n--- Day {day} ---")
            for agent in agents:
                # Agents perform their daily actions
                agent.receive_messages()  # Process incoming messages
                agent.perform_daily_tasks()
                # Agents send messages if needed
                agent.send_daily_messages()
                # Agents transition to next state if possible
                agent.transition_state()
Implementing Daily Tasks and Messages in Agents
We'll add perform_daily_tasks, send_daily_messages, and transition_state methods to agents.

Example: APMAPSAdversary
python
Copy code
class APMAPSAdversary(AgentBase):
    # Existing code...

    def perform_daily_tasks(self):
        # Depending on the state, perform tasks
        if self.state == APMState.GATHERING_REQUIREMENTS:
            self.prompt("Gathering new requirements from stakeholders.")
            # Update the product backlog
            new_requirements = "- Feature C\n- Feature D\n"
            with open('shared/product_backlog.txt', 'a') as file:
                file.write(new_requirements)
            print(f"{self.name} updated the product backlog.")

    def send_daily_messages(self):
        # Send messages to other agents
        if self.state == APMState.PRIORITIZING_BACKLOG:
            self.send_message('AD', "Please review the updated product backlog.")

    def transition_state(self):
        possible_triggers = self.possible_triggers()
        if possible_triggers:
            # Invoke the next trigger
            getattr(self, possible_triggers[0])()
            print(f"{self.name} state after transition: {self.state}")
Repeat similar implementations for other agents, tailoring their tasks and messages to their roles.

Full Code Implementation
Due to space constraints, I'll provide the code for one agent and outline how to implement the others.

Implementing ADAPSAdversary
python
Copy code
class ADAPSAdversary(AgentBase):
    def __init__(self, model_name, message_bus):
        super().__init__(name='AD', model_name=model_name, message_bus=message_bus)
        self.setup_fsm(state_enum=ADState, initial=ADState.INITIALIZING)

    # Existing methods...

    def process_message(self, message):
        super().process_message(message)
        if "product backlog" in message.content:
            print(f"{self.name} will review the product backlog.")
            # Read the product backlog
            with open('shared/product_backlog.txt', 'r') as file:
                backlog = file.read()

Conclusion
We've successfully simulated a full SAFe cycle with agents interacting through the filesystem and using messages. Agents perform tasks according to their roles, communicate via a message bus, and share artifacts through the filesystem.

Next Steps
Enhance Agents' Behaviors: Implement more detailed actions and responses based on messages and states.

Persist State: Save agents' states between runs for a more continuous simulation.

Error Handling: Add error handling for missing files or failed messages.

Concurrency: Implement asynchronous message handling for more realistic interactions.

Visualization: Create a dashboard or logs to visualize the simulation progress.

Integration with Real AI Models: Use actual AI models for predictions.

Feel free to ask if you need further assistance or specific code implementations for the remaining agents!

Gherkin Reference
Gherkin uses a set of special keywords to give structure and meaning to executable specifications. Each keyword is translated to many spoken languages; in this reference we’ll use English.

Most lines in a Gherkin document start with one of the keywords.

Comments are only permitted at the start of a new line, anywhere in the feature file. They begin with zero or more spaces, followed by a hash sign (#) and some text.

Block comments are currently not supported by Gherkin.

Either spaces or tabs may be used for indentation. The recommended indentation level is two spaces. Here is an example:

Feature: Guess the word

  # The first example has two steps
  Scenario: Maker starts a game
    When the Maker starts a game
    Then the Maker waits for a Breaker to join

  # The second example has three steps
  Scenario: Breaker joins a game
    Given the Maker has started a game with the word "silky"
    When the Breaker joins the Maker's game
    Then the Breaker must guess a word with 5 characters
The trailing portion (after the keyword) of each step is matched to a code block, called a step definition.

Please note that some keywords are followed by a colon (:) and some are not. If you add a colon after a keyword that should not be followed by one, your test(s) will be ignored.

Keywords
Each line that isn’t a blank line has to start with a Gherkin keyword, followed by any text you like. The only exceptions are the free-form descriptions placed underneath Example/Scenario, Background, Scenario Outline and Rule lines.

The primary keywords are:

Feature
Rule (as of Gherkin 6)
Example (or Scenario)
Given, When, Then, And, But for steps (or *)
Background
Scenario Outline (or Scenario Template)
Examples (or Scenarios)
There are a few secondary keywords as well:

""" (Doc Strings)
| (Data Tables)
@ (Tags)
# (Comments)
Localisation

Gherkin is localised for many spoken languages; each has their own localised equivalent of these keywords.

Feature
The purpose of the Feature keyword is to provide a high-level description of a software feature, and to group related scenarios.

The first primary keyword in a Gherkin document must always be Feature, followed by a : and a short text that describes the feature.

You can add free-form text underneath Feature to add more description.

These description lines are ignored by Cucumber at runtime, but are available for reporting (they are included by reporting tools like the official HTML formatter).

Feature: Guess the word

  The word guess game is a turn-based game for two players.
  The Maker makes a word for the Breaker to guess. The game
  is over when the Breaker guesses the Maker's word.

  Example: Maker starts a game
The name and the optional description have no special meaning to Cucumber. Their purpose is to provide a place for you to document important aspects of the feature, such as a brief explanation and a list of business rules (general acceptance criteria).

The free format description for Feature ends when you start a line with the keyword Background, Rule, Example or Scenario Outline (or their alias keywords).

You can place tags above Feature to group related features, independent of your file and directory structure.

You can only have a single Feature in a .feature file.

Descriptions
Free-form descriptions (as described above for Feature) can also be placed underneath Example/Scenario, Background, Scenario Outline and Rule.

You can write anything you like, as long as no line starts with a keyword.

Descriptions can be in the form of Markdown - formatters including the official HTML formatter support this.

Rule
The (optional) Rule keyword has been part of Gherkin since v6.

Cucumber Support for Rule

The Rule keyword is still pretty new. It has been ported in a lot of Cucumber implementation already. Yet if you encounter issues, check the documentation of your Cucumber implementation to make sure it supports it.

The purpose of the Rule keyword is to represent one business rule that should be implemented. It provides additional information for a feature. A Rule is used to group together several scenarios that belong to this business rule. A Rule should contain one or more scenarios that illustrate the particular rule.

For example:

# -- FILE: features/gherkin.rule_example.feature
Feature: Highlander

  Rule: There can be only One

    Example: Only One -- More than one alive
      Given there are 3 ninjas
      And there are more than one ninja alive
      When 2 ninjas meet, they will fight
      Then one ninja dies (but not me)
      And there is one ninja less alive

    Example: Only One -- One alive
      Given there is only 1 ninja alive
      Then he (or she) will live forever ;-)

  Rule: There can be Two (in some cases)

    Example: Two -- Dead and Reborn as Phoenix
      ...
Example
This is a concrete example that illustrates a business rule. It consists of a list of steps.

The keyword Scenario is a synonym of the keyword Example.

You can have as many steps as you like, but we recommend 3-5 steps per example. Having too many steps will cause the example to lose its expressive power as a specification and documentation.

In addition to being a specification and documentation, an example is also a test. As a whole, your examples are an executable specification of the system.

Examples follow this same pattern:

Describe an initial context (Given steps)
Describe an event (When steps)
Describe an expected outcome (Then steps)
Steps
Each step starts with Given, When, Then, And, or But.

Cucumber executes each step in a scenario one at a time, in the sequence you’ve written them in. When Cucumber tries to execute a step, it looks for a matching step definition to execute.

Keywords are not taken into account when looking for a step definition. This means you cannot have a Given, When, Then, And or But step with the same text as another step.

Cucumber considers the following steps duplicates:

Given there is money in my account
Then there is money in my account
This might seem like a limitation, but it forces you to come up with a less ambiguous, more clear domain language:

Given my account has a balance of £430
Then my account should have a balance of £430
Given
Given steps are used to describe the initial context of the system - the scene of the scenario. It is typically something that happened in the past.

When Cucumber executes a Given step, it will configure the system to be in a well-defined state, such as creating and configuring objects or adding data to a test database.

The purpose of Given steps is to put the system in a known state before the user (or external system) starts interacting with the system (in the When steps). Avoid talking about user interaction in Given’s. If you were creating use cases, Given’s would be your preconditions.

It’s okay to have several Given steps (use And or But for number 2 and upwards to make it more readable).

Examples:

Mickey and Minnie have started a game
I am logged in
Joe has a balance of £42
When
When steps are used to describe an event, or an action. This can be a person interacting with the system, or it can be an event triggered by another system.

Examples:

Guess a word
Invite a friend
Withdraw money
Imagine it's 1922

Most software does something people could do manually (just not as efficiently).

Try hard to come up with examples that don’t make any assumptions about technology or user interface. Imagine it’s 1922, when there were no computers.

Implementation details should be hidden in the step definitions.

Then
Then steps are used to describe an expected outcome, or result.

The step definition of a Then step should use an assertion to compare the actual outcome (what the system actually does) to the expected outcome (what the step says the system is supposed to do).

An outcome should be on an observable output. That is, something that comes out of the system (report, user interface, message), and not a behaviour deeply buried inside the system (like a record in a database).

Examples:

See that the guessed word was wrong
Receive an invitation
Card should be swallowed
While it might be tempting to implement Then steps to look in the database - resist that temptation!

You should only verify an outcome that is observable for the user (or external system), and changes to a database are usually not.

And, But
If you have successive Given’s or Then’s, you could write:

Example: Multiple Givens
  Given one thing
  Given another thing
  Given yet another thing
  When I open my eyes
  Then I should see something
  Then I shouldn't see something else
Or, you could make the example more fluidly structured by replacing the successive Given’s or Then’s with And’s and But’s:

Example: Multiple Givens
  Given one thing
  And another thing
  And yet another thing
  When I open my eyes
  Then I should see something
  But I shouldn't see something else
*
Gherkin also supports using an asterisk (*) in place of any of the normal step keywords. This can be helpful when you have some steps that are effectively a list of things, so you can express it more like bullet points where otherwise the natural language of And etc might not read so elegantly.

For example:

Scenario: All done
  Given I am out shopping
  And I have eggs
  And I have milk
  And I have butter
  When I check my list
  Then I don't need anything
Could be expressed as:

Scenario: All done
  Given I am out shopping
  * I have eggs
  * I have milk
  * I have butter
  When I check my list
  Then I don't need anything
Background
Occasionally you’ll find yourself repeating the same Given steps in all of the scenarios in a Feature.

Since it is repeated in every scenario, this is an indication that those steps are not essential to describe the scenarios; they are incidental details. You can literally move such Given steps to the background, by grouping them under a Background section.

A Background allows you to add some context to the scenarios that follow it. It can contain one or more Given steps, which are run before each scenario, but after any Before hooks.

A Background is placed before the first Scenario/Example, at the same level of indentation.

For example:

Feature: Multiple site support
  Only blog owners can post to a blog, except administrators,
  who can post to all blogs.

  Background:
    Given a global administrator named "Greg"
    And a blog named "Greg's anti-tax rants"
    And a customer named "Dr. Bill"
    And a blog named "Expensive Therapy" owned by "Dr. Bill"

  Scenario: Dr. Bill posts to his own blog
    Given I am logged in as Dr. Bill
    When I try to post to "Expensive Therapy"
    Then I should see "Your article was published."

  Scenario: Dr. Bill tries to post to somebody else's blog, and fails
    Given I am logged in as Dr. Bill
    When I try to post to "Greg's anti-tax rants"
    Then I should see "Hey! That's not your blog!"

  Scenario: Greg posts to a client's blog
    Given I am logged in as Greg
    When I try to post to "Expensive Therapy"
    Then I should see "Your article was published."
Background is also supported at the Rule level, for example:

Feature: Overdue tasks
  Let users know when tasks are overdue, even when using other
  features of the app

  Rule: Users are notified about overdue tasks on first use of the day
    Background:
      Given I have overdue tasks

    Example: First use of the day
      Given I last used the app yesterday
      When I use the app
      Then I am notified about overdue tasks

    Example: Already used today
      Given I last used the app earlier today
      When I use the app
      Then I am not notified about overdue tasks
  ...
You can only have one set of Background steps per Feature or Rule. If you need different Background steps for different scenarios, consider breaking up your set of scenarios into more Rules or more Features.

For a less explicit alternative to Background, check out conditional hooks.

Tips for using Background
Don’t use Background to set up complicated states, unless that state is actually something the client needs to know.
For example, if the user and site names don’t matter to the client, use a higher-level step such as Given I am logged in as a site owner.
Keep your Background section short.
The client needs to actually remember this stuff when reading the scenarios. If the Background is more than 4 lines long, consider moving some of the irrelevant details into higher-level steps.
Make your Background section vivid.
Use colourful names, and try to tell a story. The human brain keeps track of stories much better than it keeps track of names like "User A", "User B", "Site 1", and so on.
Keep your scenarios short, and don’t have too many.
If the Background section has scrolled off the screen, the reader no longer has a full overview of what’s happening. Think about using higher-level steps, or splitting the *.feature file.
Scenario Outline
The Scenario Outline keyword can be used to run the same Scenario multiple times, with different combinations of values.

The keyword Scenario Template is a synonym of the keyword Scenario Outline.

Copying and pasting scenarios to use different values quickly becomes tedious and repetitive:

Scenario: eat 5 out of 12
  Given there are 12 cucumbers
  When I eat 5 cucumbers
  Then I should have 7 cucumbers

Scenario: eat 5 out of 20
  Given there are 20 cucumbers
  When I eat 5 cucumbers
  Then I should have 15 cucumbers
We can collapse these two similar scenarios into a Scenario Outline.

Scenario outlines allow us to more concisely express these scenarios through the use of a template with < >-delimited parameters:

Scenario Outline: eating
  Given there are <start> cucumbers
  When I eat <eat> cucumbers
  Then I should have <left> cucumbers

  Examples:
    | start | eat | left |
    |    12 |   5 |    7 |
    |    20 |   5 |   15 |
Examples
A Scenario Outline must contain one or more Examples (or Scenarios) section(s). Its steps are interpreted as a template which is never directly run. Instead, the Scenario Outline is run once for each row in the Examples section beneath it (not counting the first header row).

The steps can use <> delimited parameters that reference headers in the examples table. Cucumber will replace these parameters with values from the table before it tries to match the step against a step definition.

You can also use parameters in multiline step arguments.

Step Arguments
In some cases you might want to pass more data to a step than fits on a single line. For this purpose Gherkin has Doc Strings and Data Tables.

Doc Strings
Doc Strings are handy for passing a larger piece of text to a step definition.

The text should be offset by delimiters consisting of three double-quote marks on lines of their own:

Given a blog post named "Random" with Markdown body
  """
  Some Title, Eh?
  ===============
  Here is the first paragraph of my blog post. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
  consectetur adipiscing elit.
  """
In your step definition, there’s no need to find this text and match it in your pattern. It will automatically be passed as the last argument in the step definition.

Indentation of the opening """ is unimportant, although common practice is two spaces in from the enclosing step. The indentation inside the triple quotes, however, is significant. Each line of the Doc String will be dedented according to the opening """. Indentation beyond the column of the opening """ will therefore be preserved.

Doc strings also support using three backticks as the delimiter:

Given a blog post named "Random" with Markdown body
  
Some Title, Eh?
  ===============
  Here is the first paragraph of my blog post. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
  consectetur adipiscing elit.

This might be familiar for those used to writing with Markdown.

Tool support for backticks

Whilst all current versions of Cucumber support backticks as the delimiter, many tools like text editors don’t (yet).

It’s possible to annotate the DocString with the type of content it contains. You specify the content type after the triple quote, as follows:

Given a blog post named "Random" with Markdown body
  """markdown
  Some Title, Eh?
  ===============
  Here is the first paragraph of my blog post. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
  consectetur adipiscing elit.
  """
Tool support for content types

Whilst all current versions of Cucumber support content types as the delimiter, many tools like text editors don’t (yet).

Data Tables
Data Tables are handy for passing a list of values to a step definition:

Given the following users exist:
  | name   | email              | twitter         |
  | Aslak  | aslak@cucumber.io  | @aslak_hellesoy |
  | Julien | julien@cucumber.io | @jbpros         |
  | Matt   | matt@cucumber.io   | @mattwynne      |
Just like Doc Strings, Data Tables will be passed to the step definition as the last argument.

Table Cell Escaping
If you want to use a newline character in a table cell, you can write this as \n. If you need a | as part of the cell, you can escape it as \|. And finally, if you need a \, you can escape that with \\.

Data Table API
Cucumber provides a rich API for manipulating tables from within step definitions. See the Data Table API reference reference for more details.

Spoken Languages
The language you choose for Gherkin should be the same language your users and domain experts use when they talk about the domain. Translating between two languages should be avoided.

This is why Gherkin has been translated to over 70 languages .

Here is a Gherkin scenario written in Norwegian:

# language: no
Funksjonalitet: Gjett et ord

  Eksempel: Ordmaker starter et spill
    Når Ordmaker starter et spill
    Så må Ordmaker vente på at Gjetter blir med

  Eksempel: Gjetter blir med
    Gitt at Ordmaker har startet et spill med ordet "bløtt"
    Når Gjetter blir med på Ordmakers spill
    Så må Gjetter gjette et ord på 5 bokstaver
A # language: header on the first line of a feature file tells Cucumber what spoken language to use - for example # language: fr for French. If you omit this header, Cucumber will default to English (en).

Some Cucumber implementations also let you set the default language in the configuration, so you don’t need to place the # language header in every file.



Change this to APS Reference by taking all of the SAFe style frameworks. Come to an agreement on terms for the Specification
ChatGPT

Thought for 24 seconds

Certainly! I'd be happy to help you create an APS Reference by adapting the Gherkin Reference and incorporating elements from SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) and other agile methodologies. We'll aim to define terms and structure the specification accordingly.

APS (Agile Protocol Specification) Reference
Version: 1.0.0

The APS Reference defines the syntax, keywords, and structure for writing executable specifications within the Agile Protocol Specification (APS) framework. It provides a standardized way to describe agile processes, workflows, roles, and interactions in both traditional and adversarial agile environments.

APS combines elements from various agile frameworks, including SAFe, Scrum, and Kanban, to support scalability and flexibility in agile practices.

Introduction
The Agile Protocol Specification (APS) provides a standardized language and structure for defining and documenting agile processes at scale. It facilitates clear communication among team members, stakeholders, and tools, ensuring alignment and shared understanding across the organization.

APS leverages concepts from Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and is inspired by Gherkin syntax, adapting it to suit the needs of agile teams operating within frameworks like SAFe.

Keywords
APS uses a set of special keywords to structure specifications. Each keyword serves a specific purpose in defining processes, roles, and scenarios.

Thought for 5 seconds

Certainly! Let's integrate Gantt charts, BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), and C4 model (Context, Containers, Components, Code) into the Agile Protocol Specification (APS) to represent time and space within agile processes. By combining these models, we can provide a comprehensive view of the temporal and spatial aspects of agile workflows, from high-level architecture to detailed process flows and scheduling.

Conclusion
Introduction
To provide a complete representation of agile processes, it's beneficial to incorporate models that capture different dimensions:

Time: Scheduling, durations, dependencies (Gantt charts).
Processes: Workflow, activities, and decision points (BPMN).
Architecture: System structure and components (C4 model).
By connecting Gantt charts, BPMN, and C4, we can enhance the APS framework to represent both time (when things happen) and space (where things happen within the system architecture).

Understanding the Models
Gantt Charts
Purpose: Visualize project schedules, showing activities over time, durations, start and end dates, and dependencies between tasks.
Represents: Time dimension in project management.
BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)
Purpose: Provide a graphical representation of business processes, depicting workflows, activities, events, gateways (decision points), and interactions between participants.
Represents: Process flows and activities within a business context.
C4 Model
Purpose: Describe software architecture at multiple levels of abstraction:
Context: High-level view of the system and its environment.
Containers: Applications and data stores that make up the system.
Components: Internal components within containers.
Code: Detailed design and implementation details.
Represents: Spatial structure of the software system.
Representing Time and Space in APS
In the context of APS:

Time is represented by schedules, sprint timelines, and sequencing of activities.
Space is represented by the architectural components where activities occur.
By integrating Gantt charts, BPMN, and C4, we can:

Map activities and tasks to specific time frames (Gantt charts).
Define detailed workflows and processes (BPMN).
Align activities with system architecture components (C4 model).

Incorporate Gantt charts to visualize the scheduling of processes, activities, and tasks defined in APS.
Benefits:
Provides a timeline for processes and activities.
Shows dependencies between tasks.
Aids in resource planning and workload management.
BPMN in APS
Use BPMN diagrams to detail the workflows and processes specified in APS.
Benefits:
Clarifies the sequence of activities and tasks.
Highlights decision points and branching logic.
Facilitates communication of complex processes.
C4 Model in APS
Apply the C4 model to represent the software architecture within which APS activities occur.
Benefits:
Provides context for where activities and tasks are performed in the system.
Helps in understanding the interaction between different system components.
Aids in aligning development activities with the architecture.
Combined Use Case Example
Let's illustrate how these models can be combined within APS for a feature development process.

1. Define the Process in APS
plaintext
Copy code
Process: User Authentication Feature Development

  Role: Product Manager
    Defines the feature requirements.

  Role: Developer
    Implements the feature.

  Role: Tester
    Validates the feature.

  Activity: Feature Implementation
    Tasks:
      - Design the authentication module.
      - Develop login functionality.
      - Write unit tests.

  Activity: Testing and Validation
    Tasks:
      - Perform integration testing.
      - Conduct security testing.
2. Create a BPMN Diagram
Visualize the workflow of feature implementation and testing.
Include activities and decision points:
Start Event: Feature requirement defined.
Task: Design authentication module.
Task: Develop login functionality.
Gateway: Is unit testing successful?
Yes: Proceed to integration testing.
No: Return to development.
Task: Perform integration testing.
Gateway: Is testing successful?
Yes: Proceed to deployment.
No: Return to development.
End Event: Feature deployed.
3. Map Activities on a Gantt Chart
Schedule tasks over time:
Week 1:
Design authentication module.
Week 2:
Develop login functionality.
Write unit tests.
Week 3:
Perform integration testing.
Conduct security testing.
Dependencies:
Testing tasks depend on the completion of development tasks.
4. Represent Architecture with C4 Model
Context Level:
The system interacts with users and external authentication services.
Container Level:
Web Application (Container): Where the login functionality resides.
Database (Container): Stores user credentials.
Component Level:
Authentication Service (Component): Handles login requests.
User Interface (Component): Login page.
Code Level:
Classes and methods implementing authentication logic.
5. Connect the Models
Align BPMN activities with C4 components:
Design and development tasks correspond to the Authentication Service component.
Schedule BPMN activities on the Gantt chart:
Place tasks on the timeline according to the plan.
Use the C4 model to identify where tasks occur within the system architecture.
BPMN diagrams provide the workflow, while Gantt charts provide the timing, and C4 models provide the structural context.
Extending the APS Reference
To accommodate these integrations, we can extend the APS Reference with additional sections and guidelines.

New Sections in APS Reference
Visualization Models

Introduce the use of visualization models within APS documents to represent time and space.

  Visualization:

    - See "User Authentication Workflow.bpmn" for process flow.
    - Refer to "Feature Development Schedule.gantt" for timelines.
    - Consult "Authentication Service Architecture.c4" for system context.

  Role: Developer
    Implements the authentication functionality as per the architecture.

  Activity: Develop Login Functionality
    Task: Code the Authentication Service component.
    Task: Integrate with the User Interface component.

  Activity: Testing
    Task: Write unit tests for the Authentication Service.
    Task: Perform integration tests.

BPMN Diagram: "User Authentication Workflow.bpmn"
Gantt Chart: "Feature Development Schedule.gantt"
C4 Model Diagram: "Authentication Service Architecture.c4"
Conclusion
By connecting Gantt charts, BPMN, and C4 models within the APS framework, we can effectively represent both time and space in agile processes:

Time: Gantt charts provide a clear timeline and scheduling of activities and tasks.
Processes: BPMN diagrams detail the workflow and sequence of activities.
Space: C4 models offer a structural view of the system architecture where activities occur.
This integration enhances the APS framework by:

Providing comprehensive documentation that aligns processes with architecture and timelines.
Facilitating better planning, communication, and understanding among team members.
Supporting scalability and complexity management in agile environments.
Next Steps
To implement this integration:

Update APS Documentation Templates: Incorporate sections for visualization models.

Provide Training: Educate team members on Gantt, BPMN, and C4 modeling techniques.

Use Tooling Support: Leverage tools that support these models and their integration.

Standardize Practices: Establish guidelines for when and how to use each model within APS.

Iterate and Improve: Continuously refine the integration based on feedback and evolving needs.

Please let me know if you need further details, specific examples, or assistance with any other aspect of integrating these models into the APS framework!

Converting APS to YAML and Pydantic Models
Introduction
In this response, we will:

Convert the Agile Protocol Specification (APS) Reference into YAML to achieve machine readability without the need for a specialized parser.

Create Pydantic models that represent the APS Spec, including fields with descriptions, to facilitate data validation and further automation.

Part 1: Converting APS to YAML
We will define the structure of an APS document in YAML format. This structure includes:

Process definitions
Roles and responsibilities
Activities and tasks
Scenarios and examples
Steps
Data structures
Annotations and tags
Comments
Localization settings
YAML Structure for APS
Below is the YAML representation of the APS Spec:

yaml
Copy code
# aps_spec.yaml

        content: |
          """
          Multiline content here.
          """
  annotations:
    - "@tag1"
    - "@tag2"
  comments:
    - "# This is a comment."
  localization:
    language: "en"  # Default language code

class Role(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the role.")
    description: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Description of the role and responsibilities.")

class Process(BaseModel):

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load YAML data
    import yaml

    with open('aps_spec.yaml', 'r') as file:
        yaml_data = yaml.safe_load(file)

    # Create Process instance from YAML data
    process = Process(**yaml_data['process'])

    print(process.json(indent=2))
Explanation
Comment: Represents a comment in the APS document.
Localization: Holds the language code for localization.
DocString: Represents a doc string with a name and content.
DataTable: Represents a data table with headers and rows.
DataStructures: Contains lists of data tables and doc strings.
Step: Represents a step in a scenario, with a type and description.
Scenario: Contains a name and a list of steps.
Task: Represents a task within an activity.
Activity: Contains a name, description, and a list of tasks.
Role: Represents a role with a name and description.
Process: The main model representing the APS process, including roles, activities, scenarios, data structures, annotations, comments, and localization.
Each field in the models includes a description parameter, which provides documentation for that field.

Benefits
Machine Readability: Using YAML allows for easy parsing and manipulation by machines without the need for a specialized parser.
Data Validation: Pydantic models provide data validation and type checking, ensuring that the APS documents conform to the expected structure.
Documentation: Field descriptions in Pydantic models serve as documentation, making it easier for developers to understand the data structures.
Conclusion
By converting the APS Spec into a YAML format and defining corresponding Pydantic models, we have achieved:

A machine-readable representation of the APS Spec.
A set of data models with field descriptions for validation and documentation.
An example of how to load and work with the data in Python.
This approach facilitates automation, integration with tools, and enhances the clarity and consistency of the APS documentation.

Convert this talk into a conference talk on "Writing Good APS"

i've put the links to the previous webinar here as well as the previous q a
with all the questions and answers on my blog so feel free to check those out when you get a chance
so let's go deep into gurkha now what is gherkin i've been throwing this around as a
buzzword but when i say gherkin what i'm referring to is a simple language for
specifying behaviors it comes from the cucumber project and many other bdd frameworks and projects
have adopted it and ultimately gerkin has a three-pronged syntax
we write our behaviors as given when then scenarios
given steps set up an initial state they're like a prep function or a setup
the when steps are what will initiate actions for our behaviors those could be things like
selecting an option from a drop down or clicking a button or navigating to a page it's the thing where an actor is
interacting with the product or feature under test and finally the third part are the then
steps thens are like assertions they verify the outcomes what should have happened
with our behavior what do we expect and we'll write our gherkin scenarios
in what we call feature files they're basically text files that end in
dot feature but you may hear me refer to gurken scenarios as being saved in feature
files and that's all i mean by that so let's take a look at some gherkin
here is an example feature file everything i'm showing here is correct
gurken syntax you'll notice at the top underlined in purple we have a feature section
every feature file should have one feature section with a title that describes what the feature should be
in this case here i have a shopping cart feature immediately under the feature title
we have some lines for documentation these are purely for the reader they're not used by any automation framework or
anything and as a best practice i often recommend putting the user story for this feature
here so our user story and in this case is as a shopper i want to put items to buy in a cart
so that i can hold them while shopping user stories are truly business value propositions for the
things we want to become true in these software products and features
within the feature section you can have one-to-many scenario sections and you can even see
that they're indented to show that they're under that feature this example has one scenario
add items to the cards and we see our given when then format at
play given the cart has five items
when eight items are added to the cards then the cart contains 13 items
here you can see we've set up our initial state by saying our cart has something in it
we've taken an action by adding items to our carts and then we're making sure that the
total number of items is what we expect because 5 plus eight is thirteen
some other things to note about gerkin syntax uh you'll notice those comment lines in green on the right side you can
add comments anywhere in gherkin with the hashtag symbol and anything after that hashtag will be
commented out you may also see these at sign tokens in
light blue on top of the feature section and the scenario section those are tags
and we can use those for organization and filtering
so you may be wondering why would i write my behaviors and my test cases in gherkin what is it about
this special syntax that makes it so much better than say writing a wiki page
or just writing a bullet list or paragraphs
there are quite a few advantages to writing in gherkin first of all with a feature file you have a singular
artifact of your software development process that represents the requirements
the acceptance criteria and the test cases for that behavior
it's all wrapped in one that's really nice furthermore when you formalize your
behavior specs in a language like gherkin with its keywords and its light amount of formatting
those feature files can be automated using a test framework basically that feature file can become a
test script directly and that's really nice you don't have to read a description of a test case and
then try to figure out how the automation fits into it right that feature file is part of your test
code also these feature files give clear
unambiguous examples for how the behavior should work right that's why we call it specification by example that's
why we use numbers like 5 and 8 and 13 because people will typically understand
concrete examples better than abstractions and we want to make things clear and we want to make things concise
because that will help our whole team develop the right things and finally these these feature files
are a sense of accountability because they act like a receipt or a proof of purchase for what the team had
originally planned right the in when when deciding what features to develop
going through example mapping and then writing these feature files right the team is saying this is what we want
and just to cap it all off gurken is written in plain language it's not a programming language it is a
specification language anyone can write gherkin you don't need to be a developer you don't need to know
java or python or c sharp right anyone on a team whether they're a product owner developer or tester can come
together and help specify what the behavior should be in this easy to use syntax
as i mentioned before these feature files can be used for test automation directly
and there are a number of popular bdd frameworks out there that
can use gherkin one of the more popular ones everyone's probably heard of is cucumber originally
in ruby but now popularly in java and javascript some others include spec flow and
c-sharp that's what i use day-to-day i love it python i use these regularly as well such as pi test bdd and behave
but most of these popular vdd frameworks use some variant of the gherkin language maybe with a few twists on the gherkin
syntax but overall gherkin is fairly standardized across everything
now i've made it seem like gurken is actually pretty easy and just writing given when and then and
some english behind it can be an easy entry point but while writing gherkin can be easy
writing good gherkin can be very hard there is an art to it there is a knack
to it there is a learning curve because we don't just want to write scenarios once and forget them we want them to be
scalable we want these steps to be reusable and so we want to make sure that we write good gurkhan so that it can last
for a long time and be useful so let's learn four helpful rules
together for writing good gherkin
the first rule is what i like to call gherkin's golden rule
treat other readers as you would want to be treated write your feature files so that
everyone can intuitively understand them write your feature files so that
everyone can understand them if we're trying to sell the value proposition that gherkin is easy for
everyone to pick up and run with make sure you're being friendly to to the next person who's going to pick it
up and read it let's look how this plays out
here on the screen i have two extremes of how we could write our gherkin scenarios
on the left we have an ultra declarative scenario shoes
given i want shoes when i buy shoes then i get them
contrast that to what we have on the right the ultra imperative scenario
i'm not even going to read this because the font is too small and it keeps going off the screen but we can clearly see visually we have
two very very different styles for writing gurken scenarios and each of these extremes
has problems looking at the ultra declarative
scenario first we can look at each one of these steps and show some of the major problems that
this scenario has right off the bat we can see this scenario is not really procedural right
when i write these behavior scenarios i really want them to be a step-by-step process right because that's how we
exemplify the behavior at play behaviors represent interactions and so i i need
to see some sort of interaction with the thing i'm developing here namely in this given step
we see i want shoes this is not an actionable step this is not a setup step
instead this is more of a business proposition statement
right this sort of thing would belong more in a user story
than in a gherkin scenario so keep that in mind there's a difference between user stories and
gurken scenarios and we we want to make sure that our scenarios are procedural
secondly we also see that the scenario is very vague this one step really begs the question
what what what is the behavior here what is the feature under test
how how do i go about buying these shoes this is very ethereal are we talking about a web app are we talking about a
mobile app are we talking about like a process in a store or back as we just
don't know all we know is that a customer wants to buy shoes but we haven't specified any mechanism for them
to buy those shoes the feature is essentially missing and as a result this behavior is
ambiguous if as a developer i were to receive this i wouldn't know what to develop i
wouldn't know what to implement as a tester if if i were handed this i i wouldn't even know where to begin
i'd have to go back and talk to the product owner and the developer to say what's going on here so we the the point of specification is
to eliminate that ambiguity is to bring clarity and eschew vagueness
the third problem here is that the scenario is also not verifiable this then step says i get the shoes or i
get them there's really no good way to to have
any sort of assertion there's there's really no check for the rules here right what does it mean that i receive the
shoes are they in my shopping cart do i do i have them in another place
is there some sort of transaction for which i have a receipt or a record there's nothing really being verified
here and as a result this scenario really lacks accountability even if i were to run it i'm not validating the
rules of this user story i'm not sure that i could meet the acceptance criteria and that's a problem
let's swing the pendulum to the other extreme now let's look at the ultra imperative case
this scenario i don't even know how many lines are here i've lost track i'm not going to count right now
but it's the same basic thing purchasing shoes through an app and if we were to step through the steps
here we see things like username and login we see clicks we see waiting we
see more clicks and more waiting but if you take a step back and kind of
squint your eyes a little bit you'll see the proverbial wall of text
right this is an anti-pattern anytime you write something when you have a wall of text
you it's really hard to get meaning and understanding out of it because you you you feel intimidated there's a lot of
information there and you can miss the forest for the trees in this scenario the desired behavior is
obfuscated because there are too many low-level and really somewhat unimportant steps
right if you were to write this you may understand exactly how the scenario
works when you write it but now imagine handing this off to another person and trying to explain the same behavior
are other people intuitively going to understand the behavior you're trying to cover with the scenario
and the likely answer is probably not if they even bother to read the whole
thing because it's a wall of text so that is the one of the big problems
in this one a second problem here is that we have a lot of low level interactions
if you scan through there are multiple clicks and multiple weights
they're probably if this is a web app that's probably underneath the hood just doing low-level selenium web driver
calls the problem with having these types of calls these mechanical calls at the
gherkin level is they communicate how but not so much what or why they don't give us a context
for the business value they don't reveal the business value of the behavior to us and that's why it's hard to understand
and that's why we could miss the forest for the trees what is this what does this scenario really do here right it
does i mean yes the clicks and all are part of that but that should really be an automation detail not a behavior
specification detail finally the remaining problem we have
with this scenario is that we have repeated when then pairs which means we are covering multiple
behaviors and therefore we don't have a separation of concerns the scenario is
probably doing too much or it's it has too much specification and too fine of a
detail thus leading to some of the other problems
so let's bridge the gap between these two extremes
what we really really want is a nice concise declarative scenario
that highlights the business value while providing the procedure for enacting this behavior
here i have a four line scenario adding shoes to the shopping carts
given the shoe store homepage is displayed when shoppers when the shopper searches
for red pumps and the shopper adds the first result to the cart then the cart has one pair of red pumps
very basic behavior but we've covered it fully it's declarative it shows what we want
on this web page i'm searching for a particular type of shoes i'm adding it to my cart and it's there and i'm making
sure it's there we're also following strict step order we always want to go givens then whens
and then thens setup action verification
or arrange act assert if you start to change that step order
you're no longer specifying behaviors always keep strict step order
and make sure your steps are concise say what you need to say typically i recommend people try to keep
the single digit length for scenarios so that we avoid that wall of text
and if you feel like your scenario needs to have more steps i'd recommend check
yourself before you wreck yourself right do you need to be more declarative are you covering more than one behavior and
need to split keep that in the back of your mind as as a guidepost
we also wrote these steps chronologically so that they can be automated by say cucumber or spec flow or behave
and we avoided low level interactions what matters for this behavior what matters is that a shopper did some
searching and added it to their cart does it matter precisely what button they clicked
not so much the automation can handle those details but what we want to see at the top level
is that someone is doing searching successfully and finally we also want to respect our
step types right don't mislabel whens and thens as givens just to preserve a
given when then ordering right we want to make sure we frame our behavior well
so we're about halfway through and i'm ready to take some questions and
answers if anybody has something hey so andy as you remember it takes a
little while for people to type in their answers sometimes they'll raise their hand if they don't mind being in front of about
220 or more people here but uh if folks raise their hand i'll i'll be happy to take them off a mute um
here's one that's raising their hand let's try claude i'm gonna take
them off of mute claude are you there yes i am good afternoon um so a little bit um about my
background i was a test engineer for about seven years and now i'm a systems analyst
and um because we're using um gherkin in an enterprise scenario
um there's a lot of um work and angst on trying to get the statements at the right resolution
especially as they're passed downstream uh for testing
from an analyst perspective what recommendations do you personally have
for making sure that not only we're writing good gurken but also making sure that we're focusing on
the testability aspect of the statements as well well that's great
that is a great question and that's one that a lot of teams especially enterprise level i've seen
struggle with so the the first advice i can say is make sure you have those three amigos
those three different roles collaborating on what the behavior should be and possibly also writing
gurken together even because what i find is that teams will will right-size their gherkin for their
needs right some teams are you know in in the web application space and it's all driven through web ui
but other teams they may be more on the back end and so they have other concerns they have to handle
um regardless of the product or features under test whether there's some flashy front-end thing a back-end thing or even
like a a systems process type thing um
still following some of the rules and guidelines i just mentioned you know keeping things concise keeping things
you know single digit in length sometimes people want to add more description and that can help is kind of
like a railing i would recommend possibly putting comments in place if
you if something seems a little fuzzy or refactoring some of the the step verbage you use
and really a lot of it comes down to practice right a lot of times people when they first start writing german they hit writer's
block and they're like well i'm not sure at what level i should be writing this gherkin i'm not sure if i should be you
know talking about you know specific web elements on the page or if i should be talking about specific rest api
endpoints and what i would say is try it and see for your team
right just write some stuff out on a brainstorming session look at it hold it up and you try some
of those checks does this pass the wall of text check does this pass the single
length uh single digit length test right is this chronological uh does this make
sense when i hand it to somebody else who may be down the hall and wasn't part of our little brainstorming session
right and you'll find as you collaborate and as you iterate your garcon's going to get better as you go
that's great so we have a bunch of questions now and i'm going to do one more and then we're going to keep going
keep sending in those questions folks and we'll have another time for q a at the end is that right andy yes yes
cool so here's one that asks about your example specifically so you may want to
go back to that but this individual says isn't searching and adding a cart to
different behaviors why did we add them to the same scenario using two wins
[Music] that's an excellent question searching versus adding could be
considered separate behaviors that's absolutely true what i was covering in this particular
example here this particular scenario was kind of like the user process of all right so i want to
i want to add the shoes i want to my cart and in order to get them to the point where i
add let me just do a simple search is one of my action steps and then search
add boom um i wouldn't worry too much about that
that um what am i trying to say here i wouldn't get too hung up over the case
of this example right if i actually had a shoe store web app and i were trying to write dozens of these scenarios to
aptly cover behavior um then that question would be more pertinent right i might say hey oh shoot you know this
scenario maybe it is covering two separate behaviors because searching and adding to the cart may be a little more
complicated than i imagined them to be at first and if that were the case then yes maybe
i might go and separate them out but i would still say for the sake of this example this is not a bad scenario
because the the thrust of this scenario is the the idea of basic user quick
search find something like it add to cart and i could i can argue that that that path is is one behavior in the
system from a user's perspective that's perfect we've got a bunch of other we've got a bunch of other good
questions here so i'm going to i'm going to hold them till the end but um thanks so much and let's continue cool thanks y'all yeah i love these
questions they show your thinking things cool so let's continue
oops come on there we go awesome so the second rule i want to cover is what
i call the cardinal rule of bdd and it actually hits on that second question that was just asked
the cardinal rule of bdd states one scenario should cover exactly one
individual independent behavior one scenario to one behavior
the cardinal rule will bring us a lot of benefits when it comes to bdd when it comes to specifying these behaviors
when we focus on one behavior at a time we get all these good things
when it comes to collaboration when we focus on one thing at a time there's less confusion there's less
complication right we we can all be on the same page with discussing the same thing and knock
it out a lot faster in terms of automation when we take these feature files
and we take them as test cases and write the step definitions whenever bdd framework and then we run them say in
continuous integration when every scenario points to one behavior
then we also know that each test failure will point to a unique problem our triage time is going to be much
faster right we don't have to step through the trace deeply of a test
to figure out exactly where something went wrong we know from the title of the scenario this is the behavior that
failed this is the place where the problem is and we don't have to worry about that
being a misnomer for a different problem in terms of efficiency focusing on one
thing at a time meets means that each individual work item is inherently less complex
and that will lead us as a team to faster cycle times right we can get through implementing the behavior we can
get through implementing the automation it's more streamlined more sensible less complex and therefore we can move a lot
faster as a team and that's really nice we also have improved traceability
we can tie a direct line from inspiration down to implementation
how so well if we have one behavior we have one example for that behavior
which means one gurken scenario which means one test case which then when it comes to running the test means one test
results and possibly one failure with one root cause we'll know exactly how that traced
through our entire process that's really nice to have and finally we also have better
accountability we don't have this huge wall of text we don't obfuscate our behaviors we don't
sidestep or avoid behaviors we know exactly what we are developing we know
exactly what we're testing it's completely transparent and we can be true to our intentions
so let's take a look at a scenario here a basic product search again
given the shoe store home page is displayed when search phrase red pumps is entered
in case anybody's wondering this is what a pair of red pumps looks like i had to go look this up myself
when the search phrase red pumps is entered then results for red pumps are shown
when the user searches for images from the results page then the image results for red pumps are
shown here's a question how many behaviors are covered by this
scenario two
uh-oh we have a problem this scenario covers two behaviors
it's very easy to pick that out because we have duplicate when then pairs right
i repeat action and verification and action and verification again
right we don't want to have this because if i were to run this as a test and the
first search fails there's no way i'm even going to get to the the images
and when i'm talking about a simple product search in the title there there's nothing indicating there's anything to
do with an image search as well so that can lead to some ambiguity and some possibly wonky things going on
what would be much preferable is to separate these behaviors out into two scenarios
now there's a trick here because we need to do an initial search before we can
get to the results page and then click that image search link so how do we separate these out
not as tricky as you might think
here i've written two scenarios the first one covers the simple web search given the shoe store homepage is
displayed when i do my search then the basic results are shown
the second scenario is where things become a little more interesting this scenario is called simple web image
search notice my given step here is phrased rather interestingly
given shoe store search results for red pumps are displayed
as you recall our given step sets up an initial state right the
initial state doesn't always need to be the login page or the home page
we can start our scenarios in media rest in the middle of the action
so what's the middle of the action here well i i want my starting point to be i'm already at a search results page
because i want to start on the search results page and hit the button to make it into an image result
so that's how i specified my given step and my ones and thens are going to be
the same i have two scenarios now so that i'm covering these behaviors separately
in the case where a simple web search is working but an image search is not
i'll have the first scenario passing and the second scenario failing thus leading to what i said before about greater
traceability and greater accountability and failures pointing to exactly one
problem in the previous scenario there was one scenario that would have failed but i wouldn't have known which of those two
behaviors was actually the culprit without doing some deeper digging
our next rule is what i call the unique example rule don't include unnecessary examples
focus on unique input equivalence classes focus on equivalence classes now you may
not be familiar with this term equivalence classes but we'll talk about it
so here's another example in this case my feature file has a scenario outline
now if you're familiar with gherkin you probably already know what this is but as a quick recap scenario outlines are just like any
other scenarios with the catch that they are essentially scenario templates
they include an examples table with sets of input rows
and the example every row in the examples table will be substituted into steps in
the scenario outline so you can have somewhat of data-driven testing with
these scenario outlines it's a way to really stretch what one scenario can do without a lot of copy-paste redundancy
so here in this scenario outline i've got my basic product search again you start at your shoe store page you search
for something you verify results but this time instead of hard coding the type of shoes
i am substituting multiple different types of shoes as my search phrase i have seven
rows in my examples table so if i were to automate and run this test there would essentially be seven tests
executed for this one scenario outline but here's the the kicker
are all of these examples really necessary right let's take a look at what these
examples are they're all just different types of shoes red pumps sneakers
sandals flip-flops flats slippers and running shoes
right and all this behavior is checking is that a basic search works meaning you
type in something and you get something out we're not testing any sorts of filtering
we're not checking to make sure the images are necessarily correct it's just a basic i put it in i got something
basic out so are all these examples necessary i would argue probably not
right each of these different types of shoes doesn't really add much additional value
and that's what we mean by equivalence classes right an equivalence class is a set of inputs that all yield roughly the
same kind of output right is it really that much different to search for
flip flops versus sandals in our case probably not maybe there's a little tiny bit of a difference but is is it worth
taking that extra execution time to get it that may not be worth the case does it
add extra understanding for the example of this behavior i can kind of understand this example without needing
multiple types to to explain it to me i i get it so anytime we have
inputs that are of the same equivalence class we truly ought to
remove those duplicates right they don't add value for our understanding
they don't genuinely increase our test coverage and they also waste test execution time
this is especially bad for certain domains like web ui testing or mobile testing where the typical test case can
take about a minute now if you think about that in terms of execution time here
with one with one example in my table this test would take one minute if i had all of
these it would take seven minutes now in the industry
it's very very common to have test suites that are hundreds to thousands of test cases large so we're talking
hundreds to thousands of extra minutes of testing that's a lot of compute resource and
that's a lot of money and that's a lot of time wasted getting to delivery so be mindful of that always look for
equivalence classes that you can remove and be careful because when it when you
specify in the gherkin here it's very very easy just to add extra rows and columns to examples tables without
thinking of the consequence so do simplification by example
finally our fourth rule is what i like to call the the fourth amigo rule
pretend that your high school english teacher is the fourth amigo reading your gherkin
pretend that your high school english teacher is reading your gherkin
now if you're like me you may have entered software and tech and computer science to get away from english
but english still matters and proper english matters right we want our behavior scenarios to be readable and
expressive and we also need our steps to be reusable if we don't use good language in in our
gherkin then it's going to be very very tough to reuse steps in fact they may become
incompatible it can also be very hard to to communicate and to understand the
behaviors when there's poor grammar or misspellings or inconsistent phrases
right all that sort of bad english can really ruin the benefits we seek from this type
of behavior specification it can make things confusing and it could also lead to steps being used
improperly so using good grammar using good spelling
using good phrasing is very very very important all those things we learned
from our high school english classes come back to help us here in terms of how to write well
and let's see a couple ways in how this comes out
first of all we need to decide a point of view for how to write our scenarios
here i have our basic shoe store searching scenario written in two ways in first person as
well as in third person on the right or on the left first person
given i am at the shoe store home page when i enter red pumps into the search bar then i see links related to red
pumps on the results page i me my all first person all putting
myself as the narrator as the initiator of the action in this scenario
contrast that to what third person looks like given the shoe store home page is displayed
when the user searches for red pumps then links related to red pumps are shown on the results page
right the same behavior is covered it's just we're stating our steps in slightly different ways
based on first person or third person so the question is which one is better
how should i be doing this now opinions rage on this and there are
people out there who will side one or the other my opinion is strongly that third person
perspective is better and the reason why is because first person can be ambiguous
who am i am i a regular user am i an administrator am
i some sort of other system or process what happens when i have two users on
the system at the same time first person can be kind of limited and you have to do the hokey pokey to
make the the steps work with it whereas on the other hand third person
perspective can expressively name any user or system component it is objective formal and unambiguous
and thereby it's also more powerful so i strongly strongly recommend using third person over first person
now i can respect folks who want to use first person as well because there are
advantages to that but at the end of the day all steps must use the same points of
view whether it's first or third if you mix steps with perspective
you get ugliness and confusion like with this scenario given i am at the shoe store homepage
when the user searches for red pumps then i see web page links for red pumps
so timeout am i the user is there another interloper coming in to do searching for me
this scenario doesn't specify that it's ambiguous it's unclear so
remember steps may be shared between scenarios especially when it comes to automation stick with one point of view
and i strongly recommend that to be third person
another englishy thing to pay attention to are subject predicate phrases all steps should use subject predicate
phrases you have the starter noun you have the verb and maybe a direct object or
prepositional phrase consider this scenario here at the right i've covered up the first couple steps
but i've left a few steps at the bottom and image links for sneakers and video
links for sneakers these steps are not subject predicate
phrases they might be subjects they might be direct objects we don't know
what exactly are these steps supposed to be doing should we be verifying that these image links and video links appear
on the page should we be clicking them the steps in and of themselves don't give us the proper context and that's
because they're not written as subject predicate phrases let's rewrite them
now we have and the results page shows image links for sneakers now we can see that these steps are
clear we are trying to verify that they appear on a particular page
and when i see these steps now and know what they are based on their context i'm more likely to reuse them in other
scenarios which will help out tremendously for future testing
if we remove the entire covering no surprise again it's our basic searching scenario just in a different format
subject predicate phrases really help to capture the context for steps the scenarios will also provide context
if i had shown you the entire scenario at first but with the original versions of those
then steps you would have read it and understood the scenario and what the steps are trying to do
however if i were to take away the context of that scenario the steps are now not as meaningful
and imagine if i were to go write another scenario and misuse those steps that would cause all sorts of problems
for understandability collaboration and automation
each step must make sense in its own right each step must make sense in its own
context so make sure when you write these steps you're being specific about
what the thing is where it is what should be happening with it all the pertinent details
so i've dumped a lot of information on y'all let's tie it together
we've learned a lot today primarily we've learned that anyone can write good gurkhan
anybody can use gherkin it's a plain language or a it's it's plain language
syntax it's meant to be accessible for everyone and we also know that these gurken scenarios have the added benefit because
they can be automated as tests as well they serve to be requirements acceptance criteria and test cases as
one artifact we also looked at four rules for good gurken
first of all being gherkin's golden rule treat other readers as you want to be treated write your scenarios so everyone
can understand them rule number two the cardinal rule one scenario should have one behavior
rule number three the unique example rule focus on equivalence classes don't add
needless examples and finally number four the fourth amigo
rule pretend like your high school english teacher reads your gherkin follow good writing practices
so before we get to questions i just want to share a few more resources with you there's more about this topic than i
can cover in a one-hour webinar so please check out my blog at automationpanda.com i've written a lot
about bdd gherkin good gurken test automation all the above so i'd love to see you
come visit there a couple other websites i recommend if you haven't seen it already check out
test automation university there are free online courses with videos transcripts and quizzes
their stuff is almost all about test automation but you also get other topics like test strategy maybe some bdd maybe
some deeper technology stuff it's it's it's amazing i love test automation university
uh the cucumber website and spec solutions website also have good information about bdd and the following books i also recommend
bdd in action as well as the cucumber book so with that uh i that's the conclusion
of my slides and we can move on to other things hey andy that was wonderful i really
appreciate it this is great and uh by the way um plus 100 for using subject predicate
properly within a tech webinar oh cool yeah yeah good work nobody had
that on their buzzword bingo we have a couple other questions here
and i'm having trouble getting the screen back over to me so if you can make me the presenter or do something to help me out there that would be great
okay uh stop showing my screen do that on my side as well but it looks like i'm having trouble
maybe i can do it this way um yeah so there was there we go thank you very much the problem
let's see if this works hopefully you guys are seeing the slides great so a couple questions before we
close this up so one was from jefferson i really liked uh this one how do you
handle setting up a very low level scenario without having a wall of text
and keep the good gherkin precise oh that's a that's a great question
without knowing the domain of what that low level thing is it's a little hard to answer but one thing i'll often do
particularly if i'm writing gherkin as part of test automation i like to handle a lot of low-level
setup such as let's say launching selenium webdriver or something in test automation hooks i know we
didn't really talk about that too much in this webinar but all the bdd frameworks can have logic inserted
before scenario or after a scenario all the details that aren't really pertinent at the taste test case level but are
very pertinent for setting up test automation that should be handled at the automation layer and hooks are a great
way to handle that awesome awesome so we're running out of time i want to be respectful of people's
times i know that many people have meetings or whatever at two o'clock here in just a minute a couple things i want
to mention before we get into who's going to win the amazon gift card number one andy will be at pi ohio this weekend in
columbus ohio is that right andy correct and this is a python conference in columbus ohio i hope i've got that right
yes and it's free i don't know if their tickets are still being sold but if you're in the columbus area and you want to see andy or you want to get involved
more with python that sounds like a great place to go i want to talk about a couple other things we're currently going through
a really great project with one of our clients in uh who's moving over to doing more automation with this type of thing
bdd acceptance test driven development it's going really well i'm looking forward to sharing a little bit more of that in a case study soon
but all of this information we have here are things that we go through with our clients and that we help our clients
with either through consultations or training or using our people our dedicated experts so keep that in mind
as you go from here also we have a two-day bdd class we come into your office place we work with your
people to learn about bdd make sure to reach out to me paul merrill about that or go to the website ask us about it
there's more information there so without further ado let's figure out who's going to win this and i believe i
have a drum roll here and the winner is natalya b so if
natalya is your name and your last name starts with a b you have just won the 50 amazon gift card congratulations
i'm happy for you excited for you and i hope you enjoy the gift card from beaufort fairmont get bdd
get good gherkin call us today here's my contact information reach out to us on beaufort fairmont
we'd be happy to help out with what you're doing thank you so much for your time today for joining us and we look
forward to seeing you on the 20th of august for melissa tandy thank you so much and have

Writing Good APS: Crafting Effective Agile Protocol Specifications
By [Your Name]

Introduction
Hello everyone, and thank you for joining me today for this conference session on "Writing Good APS". I'm excited to dive deep into the world of Agile Protocol Specification (APS) and share insights on how we can write effective and meaningful APS documents that enhance our agile practices.

For those who are new to APS, think of it as a structured language for specifying agile processes, similar to how Gherkin is used in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for specifying behaviors. APS allows us to define processes, roles, activities, tasks, and scenarios in a clear and standardized way.

Understanding APS
What is APS?
APS stands for Agile Protocol Specification. It's a simple, structured language designed to specify agile processes and workflows. APS provides a standardized way to document:

Processes: High-level workflows or procedures.
Roles: Participants involved in the processes.
Activities and Tasks: Actions performed by roles.
Scenarios: Concrete examples illustrating processes.
Steps: Actions and expected outcomes within scenarios.
Why APS?
Clarity: Provides unambiguous specifications.
Collaboration: Facilitates communication among team members.
Automation: Can be parsed and used by tools for automation and validation.
Consistency: Standardizes the way we document processes.
The Importance of Good APS
Writing APS is straightforward, but writing good APS requires attention to detail and adherence to best practices. Good APS documents:

Serve as a single source of truth for requirements, acceptance criteria, and test cases.
Enhance collaboration among product owners, developers, and testers.
Enable automation, integrating smoothly with tools and frameworks.
Provide clear and unambiguous examples of desired behaviors.
Four Rules for Writing Good APS
Let's explore four helpful rules that can guide us in writing effective APS documents.

Rule 1: APS's Golden Rule
Treat other readers as you would want to be treated. Write your APS documents so that everyone can intuitively understand them.

Clarity is Key: Ensure that your APS is easily understandable by all team members.
Avoid Ambiguity: Be precise in your language to prevent misunderstandings.
Consider the Audience: Remember that APS documents are read by diverse roles.
Example:

Poor APS:

yaml
Copy code
process:
  name: "Feature X"
  description: "Implement Feature X"

scenario:
  name: "Scenario 1"
  steps:
    - type: "Given"
      description: "User wants to use Feature X"
    - type: "When"
      description: "User uses Feature X"
    - type: "Then"
      description: "Feature X works"
Issues:

Vague Descriptions: Steps lack detail and clarity.
Unclear Intent: The scenario doesn't provide meaningful information.
Good APS:

yaml
Copy code
process:
  name: "User Authentication"
  description: "Process for authenticating users"

scenario:
  name: "Successful Login"
  steps:
    - type: "Given"
      description: "A registered user exists with username 'alice' and password 'password123'"
    - type: "When"
      description: "The user attempts to log in using valid credentials"
    - type: "Then"
      description: "The user is granted access to the dashboard"
Benefits:

Clear Steps: Each step provides specific information.
Understandable Flow: Easy to follow the process from start to finish.
Rule 2: The Cardinal Rule of APS
One scenario should cover exactly one individual, independent process or behavior.

Focus on Single Behavior: Each scenario should target a specific aspect of the process.
Improves Traceability: Easier to link scenarios to specific requirements or test cases.
Simplifies Automation: Tests derived from APS are more manageable.
Example:

Poor APS (Multiple behaviors in one scenario):

yaml
Copy code
scenario:
  name: "Login and Access Profile"
  steps:
    - type: "Given"
      description: "User is on the login page"
    - type: "When"
      description: "User logs in with valid credentials"
    - type: "Then"
      description: "User is redirected to the dashboard"
    - type: "When"
      description: "User navigates to profile page"
    - type: "Then"
      description: "User's profile information is displayed"
Issues:

Multiple Behaviors: Login and profile access are separate behaviors.
Complexity: Scenario becomes long and harder to understand.
Good APS (Separated behaviors):

yaml
Copy code
scenario:
  name: "Successful Login"
  steps:
    - type: "Given"
      description: "User is on the login page"
    - type: "When"
      description: "User logs in with valid credentials"
    - type: "Then"
      description: "User is redirected to the dashboard"

scenario:
  name: "Access Profile Page"
  steps:
    - type: "Given"
      description: "User is logged in and on the dashboard"
    - type: "When"
      description: "User navigates to the profile page"
    - type: "Then"
      description: "User's profile information is displayed"
Benefits:

Clarity: Each scenario focuses on a single behavior.
Reusability: Steps can be reused in different scenarios.
Rule 3: The Unique Example Rule
Don't include unnecessary examples. Focus on unique input equivalence classes.

Avoid Redundancy: Only include examples that provide additional value.
Optimize Test Coverage: Focus on inputs that exercise different paths.
Example:

Poor APS (Redundant examples):

yaml
Copy code
scenario:
  name: "User Login with Various Credentials"
  steps:
    - type: "Given"
      description: "User is on the login page"
    - type: "When"
      description: "User logs in with username '<username>' and password '<password>'"
    - type: "Then"
      description: "User is granted access"

examples:
  - username: "user1"
    password: "pass1"
  - username: "user2"
    password: "pass2"
  - username: "user3"
    password: "pass3"
  - username: "user4"
    password: "pass4"
Issues:

Same Equivalence Class: All examples test valid credentials.
Execution Time: Additional tests increase execution time without adding value.
Good APS:

Include only unique equivalence classes, such as valid credentials, invalid username, invalid password, and locked account.

yaml
Copy code
examples:
  - username: "validUser"
    password: "validPass"
    description: "Valid credentials"

  - username: "invalidUser"
    password: "validPass"
    description: "Invalid username"

  - username: "validUser"
    password: "invalidPass"
    description: "Invalid password"

  - username: "lockedUser"
    password: "validPass"
    description: "Locked account"
Benefits:

Effective Coverage: Tests cover different scenarios.
Efficiency: Reduces unnecessary test executions.
Rule 4: The Fourth Amigo Rule
Pretend that your high school English teacher is the fourth amigo reading your APS.

Use Proper Grammar: Ensures clarity and professionalism.
Consistent Point of View: Stick to either first person or third person, preferably third person.
Subject-Predicate Phrases: Each step should be a complete thought.
Example:

Poor APS (Inconsistent and improper grammar):

yaml
Copy code
scenario:
  name: "Data Entry"
  steps:
    - type: "Given"
      description: "User on the data entry page"
    - type: "When"
      description: "Enter data"
    - type: "Then"
      description: "Data saved"
Issues:

Incomplete Sentences: Steps are fragments.
Lacks Clarity: Difficult to understand what's happening.
Good APS:

yaml
Copy code
scenario:
  name: "Data Entry and Save"
  steps:
    - type: "Given"
      description: "The user is on the data entry page"
    - type: "When"
      description: "The user enters valid data"
    - type: "And"
      description: "The user clicks the 'Save' button"
    - type: "Then"
      description: "The system saves the data successfully"
Benefits:

Complete Thoughts: Each step is a full sentence.
Clarity: Easy to understand and follow.
Practical Examples
Let's apply these rules to a practical example.

Scenario: Adding Items to Cart
Poor APS:

yaml
Copy code
scenario:
  name: "Add Items"
  steps:
    - type: "Given"
      description: "I want items"
    - type: "When"
      description: "Add items"
    - type: "Then"
      description: "Items added"
Issues:

Vague Steps: Lacks detail.
First Person Perspective: Inconsistent with best practices.
No Clear Behavior: Difficult to understand the process.
Good APS:

yaml
Copy code
scenario:
  name: "Add Item to Shopping Cart"
  steps:
    - type: "Given"
      description: "The shopper is on the product page for 'Wireless Mouse'"
    - type: "When"
      description: "The shopper adds the item to the shopping cart"
    - type: "Then"
      description: "The shopping cart shows '1' item"
    - type: "And"
      description: "The shopping cart total reflects the price of the 'Wireless Mouse'"
Benefits:

Detailed Steps: Clear and specific.
Third Person Perspective: Consistent and professional.
Specific Behavior: Focused on one action.
Questions and Answers
Now, I'd like to open the floor for questions. Please feel free to ask anything about writing good APS, challenges you've faced, or any clarifications you need.

Conclusion and Resources
In conclusion, writing good APS is an art that requires practice and attention to detail. By following the four rules we've discussed, you can create APS documents that are clear, effective, and valuable to your team.

Recap of the Four Rules:
APS's Golden Rule: Write for others as you'd have them write for you.
The Cardinal Rule of APS: One scenario per behavior.
The Unique Example Rule: Focus on unique inputs that add value.
The Fourth Amigo Rule: Use proper grammar and consistent perspective.

You said:
0:00:00 Alright guys, so today we're getting started on our DS-Pi powered, uhm, code assistant. So, if you're looking for somebody for full-time DS-Pi work, uh, please reach out.
0:00:15 I am available. So, let's get started. What we're working on right now is, I wanted to shout out these guys.
0:00:24 they came up with this thing called a code context file. Specification. So, Agentic Insights. Uhm, so, I came up, so yeah, it's a proposal for a flexible tool-agnostic code-based context system that helps teach AI coding tools about your code base.
0:00:45 Super easy to get started, just create a contact MD, the root of your project. right so the tooling that they have so far is a linter for it and so the linter actually has code to context in it so what we'll do is we'll go over what it is and then I'll go over my version right so you know env files editor
0:01:13 configs help shape your coding environment right because the I think the better one to think about is like the prettier RC file.
0:01:25 So let's look at dot RC file. Okay, so, for instance, in this, it's really describing how you code right what prettier will do is if you put in code that does not meet the standards, it will completely change your code and you'll be meeting the team standards.
0:01:52 So it provides the, you know, they use the word guardrails for like AI safety is very similar thing. And so you take this principle and then you apply it to the output, specifically in the arts context.
0:02:07 In our case, we will have it be, uhm, in a, in a specific format. So it's a really cool pattern.
0:02:16 Really like it. They actually have this prompt for, uhm, creating these files, right? And so, So, you know, as usual, I have a custom GPT for this, so if we go to chat, GPT.
0:02:32 I'll post the link for this, uhm, in the lounge. Custom meta prompt. Yeah, so, so this meta prompt is, uhm, empty.
0:02:49 Okay, uhm, we have a different one. Okay, sorry, codebase context assistant, right? So, this is, uhm, if we edit it and we look, We got a modified version of this prompt, right?
0:03:06 So, uhm, I'll share this. Uh, share. Copy link. We'll post this in the lounge. So we got the code, oh yeah.
0:03:21 So, we also have something that I created, similar to this, but actually like kind of next level. I call it the code blueprint, so let's see if we can Yeah.
0:03:35 Okay, so what the code blueprint does is, this is based initially off of Ager, but I mean, really it could be any project.
0:03:43 Uhm, you're basically describing specifically what you want the coding assistant to do, right? Created as part of the blueprint. The tool will ensure these files exist before proceeding with any operations.
0:03:58 files to edit. List of files that Code Generalization Tool will edit. These files are the focus of the tool's modifications or enhancements.
0:04:03 Uhm, read-only files considered for part of the context, right? Uhm, a test command, a link command, uhm, auto-commit, uh, you can provide additional, you know, any number of arguments, and then here you have this context files, right?
0:04:23 So, it's very specifically what we're talking about. So, I started taking this to the next level because Because what everybody lies with, You know, all these tutorial videos of people using, and we're just going to use Adr as an example, uhm, We'll go to the Adr, uhm, code, so, uhm, chat, examples, 
0:04:48 example chat, so we'll start here, right? So, this is not like how you would talk to a coder, like a human coder, right?
0:04:57 This is also one of the things that I always want to point out is the language model, excuse me, the language model already knows how to do this, right?
0:05:07 So this is not, one, nobody needs a Fibonacci endpoint, and, uhm, so let's open up the game, uhm, this is better, right?
0:05:20 Uhm, still, this is, this is not doing very much, right? Uhm, Multi-file change. Prompt to load. GetInputMockingFunctions. Okay, so then we're, uhm, this is closer, right?
0:05:37 But still, we're changing from a standard to something else. So, uhm, again, uhm, let me see. Sup, Karthik? Uhm, we're just going over, uhm, how Ada specifically works, and see you later.
0:05:56 Uhm, going over how Ada works so that we can then make our code blend. So, for instance, like, let's, let's take this.
0:06:05 Perfect example. Because this looks like a lot of, a lot of good stuff was getting done. So, if we copy all of this.
0:06:17 And we go to the code blueprint. Uhm, well, actually, we can do the code-based context assistant. So, we'll take this, and we'll say, uhm, Can you create a code base context file for this?
0:06:34 Let's see what it does. Okay. Structured overview. Command line interface interacts with users using prompt toolkit for input output has test case validity, right?
0:06:48 So, here, we're, we're getting the files, we're getting the technologies. Now, one of the things that we're gonna get into that, uhm, I discovered, or discovered, or really thought about, is one of the main problems that VMs always have is the version of software that they know about is almost always
0:07:08 different than the most recent version, or the most best practice version. So, I think that there's gonna be certain things that, if you want to get it to make what you want to make, you're gonna have to tell it ahead of time.
0:07:21 But the challenge is there's so much stuff that you need to tell it ahead of time that even this isn't, this is too high level, right?
0:07:29 It's Good, it's a great start. But it's still too high level. So now, let's go grab our Code Blueprint file.
0:07:38 And, uhm, we have these Enterprise Code Blueprints. So this is something we'll get into. So, Code Blueprint, this is kind of like your junior level, right?
0:07:48 It's just making the files. This Enterprise level, this is like senior level, right? Because at a senior level, sure, we're creating files read-only, but you also have to consider security, compliance, what it integrates.
0:08:02 And the Dependency Graph, Scaling Strategy, Deployment Strategy, Monitoring Requirements, Rollback Plan, Autolog, and Notification Channels, right? So, all of these things, you know, there might be more, but that's the, this is another piece of it, right?
0:08:19 These are things that you always have to consider when you're writing a new piece of code. This is very difficult to define for every single file, which is why we have this.
0:08:28 So, let's just grab this and go ahead and say, uhm, can you represent, can you represent the conversation and changes exactly as if the person was using Code Blueprint YAML files?
0:08:58 So, let's see what it looks like when you're using the Code Blueprint. Okay. Test main input output refactor, right?
0:09:12 So we got this files to create, test main, so let's see if, where it created that, right? Okay. Modify the test main file, okay.
0:09:27 So we'll have to change that. Well, so, one of the things is that actually, and this is a That's perfect.
0:09:32 Example is I have it, uhm, maybe, maybe not. We'll, we'll go into here and say, uhm, okay. So yeah, so it's not, uhm, oh yeah, files to edit.
0:09:47 Sorry, files to edit. Yeah, not files to create. Oh, well it has to create the test main. So we'll fix that, figure that out.
0:09:58 So then the context files. So even this, right, we're not using the test main. The specific blueprint. But if you think about it, like this is, and actually this is a good example, is this is helping provide a way of how it thinks about the project over time, right?
0:10:14 Final blueprint changes, right? So we can look at what it thinks about the process, right? And so we're not gonna get too far into this, but again if you think about it, right, these are all things that, you know, I bet you just, Usually if, like, somebody was writing a YouTube video, they actually probably
0:10:36 went through this a bunch of times to actually try and get it right, that they probably didn't get it right like this on the first shot.
0:10:43 Just my, my guess, uhm. So, this is a start, right? And we're gonna say, uhm, you got some of them wrong.
0:10:55 I need you to, uh, we can do a Say, uhm. First, provide the direct quote from the conversation between Adr and the user.
0:11:14 Then create the code blueprint that matches exactly. Right. We're getting much more specific. Even I'm getting more specific. Okay, so we got two things going on.
0:11:32 So here, okay, so here you notice it stopped doing the files to create problem.
0:11:44 So, it used text and then blueprint breakdown. So, in this case, it now makes it into one. Which is interesting.
0:12:06 It's close. So, it's, it grabbed one, so here it should be at least in terms of, Okay, yeah, see, so, uh, we can do it like this and then, heh, I'm getting this error, right?
0:12:22 Immediately it first gets an error. I made a mistake, right? Need to pass those input-output options, right? I'm getting this error.
0:12:30 So, you know just like even in the air aider documentation, like, three times the person has to tell it that it failed, right?
0:12:37 And so, we got this code blueprint and so this is good. We'll say I prefer this response and then, uhm, we can see, uh, how this would work, right?
0:12:49 So, what we'll do is we'll take this and actually that's one of the things is we'll just stick with this.
0:12:53 So, let, now let's go into the enterprise example. So now okay, now let's create the yaml file for the enterprise version of this conversation.
0:13:20 And so, we'll see what the enterprise version looks like to give you guys a different perspective. Okay, compliance with best practices.
0:13:32 Testability, scaling, and integration, right? So, if we look at it, so we got encryption, access control, integration points, dependency graph, scaling strategy.
0:13:53 So, for instance, we can go from the dependency graph and walk backwards to see, do any of these need to be changed, right?
0:14:00 monitoring requirements, notifications. e-mail and slack, right? GitHub actions. So, now, we have an idea of, and whether or not these are correct or not, we can, you know, play with the, the code blueprint, right?
0:14:16 So, now, if we go back, uhm, we didn't do the code blueprint, this one, sorry guys. Oh, you, but we're using the code-based context, GPT.
0:14:24 So, hopefully, this gives you guys a perspective of, like, these are, for me, if I'm programming this in an enterprise environment, uhm, these are all the things that I have to consider.
0:14:35 So, this is kind of where, uh, you know, where you get to, umm, you have entry level, you have senior, staff, principle, distinguished, architect, you know, a lot of these things.
0:14:49 So, once you start getting to the staff and above levels, these are things that you have to consider. Um, fortunately, there are things that maybe we can get automatically configured.
0:14:59 So, that's the code blueprint, right? Um, so, . And so, since we have the code blueprint, we can, um, get into running the code blueprint where we can make it with DSPY.
0:15:14 So, that's, that's one of the things that I'm doing here, um, I should be doing. Let's see, um, delete this.
0:15:23 This is from Running Ador. One of the, the things about all of this, is it always has to run on, uh, Foro Mini.
0:15:32 So. So it's a, it adds a very, a lot of degrees of difficulty, but it also makes you have to specify more what you want.
0:15:40 So there's like a, kind of like a double edge part to it. Um, okay. So you got this create code blueprint.
0:15:47 Um, create blueprint logic. So this is a blueprint command. So you can see this hello world. Um, see if we have the context.
0:15:58 Okay, this is the context as a string. Main. . So we have some other stuff we can work on. So let's get on the, the, um, coding assistant from DSP.
0:16:16 Alright, so. What we're going to do is we're going to start from a new CLI file. That's how I like to, to start these things.
0:16:28 So we have our, our main CLI. And so we're going to create a new key. Command um, and we're going to call it cd.dot.
0:16:39 founding. We're going to say , uh, some named, help. We'll just look at what we have. Okay, so there's a lot of stuff you can see I've been very busy.
0:16:56 Okay. So let's um, call assist. So we'll do, um. Mm. Sanjin, CMD, new, assist, um, assist, and then we'll say, um, blueprint.
0:17:23 Okay, so we got our assist sub-command created. Plug-ins, it's something new that I'm working on. Okay, so we have our assist, we have our blueprint.
0:17:36 Um, let's, uh, run it. Oops. So I'm getting used to working with, um, this. I'm using cursor.
0:17:49 Um, okay, so we're going to go here. We're going to Sanjin. Assist. Help.
0:18:03 Okay, so we got blueprint. Cool. Running the blueprint sub-command. Okay, so then let's create a unit test. So we go test commands.
0:18:20 And we'll just do a new file. Actually, let's see if, if, uh, oh yeah, we'll just do it here. Test.
0:18:29 Blueprint. CMD dot pi. Alright, so then let's do this here. Add, um, blueprint. Um, CMD.
0:18:44 Oh, wait, no, it's assist. Assist CMD. Um, and we'll rename this. Um, here we do it like this.
0:18:58 Thanks. So, we have our assist.
0:19:08 Um, we're gonna delete that. And actually what you can do here is you can split it. Right. Close it. Refresh.
0:19:23 There it goes. So then, um, delete that. Uh, create unit test. So, there we go. Um, okay. So then, we can, so I had some tests that weren't working. Um, so let's, let's do, um, how to watch commands. So in here we have this pyproject.toml.
0:20:00 We're gonna refresh this. And we're gonna say. We have our tasks, uh, docs, ppi.
0:20:13 Let's see, test. Dot test. Coverage, okay. So then what we're gonna say here, is we're gonna say, um, can you add a watch?
0:20:32 Watch is. So we need to add pi test watch.
0:20:58 Perfect. Okay, so, oh yeah, with this gherkin, we're doing, uh, business driven to- but it's cool that it's running. We'll just turn that off later.
0:21:07 Um, if that's not what we're learning, we're doing, uh, PA pi test. And what we'll do is we'll go to test generate gherkin.
0:21:26 whatever. We're not messing with it.
0:22:06 Alright. So then, we can do P-T-W. Okay. Potasks. Cool. So let's see if that works. And we'll open up the um, terminal.
0:22:26 Excuse me, terminal here, so we can make sure. So, Poe, watch. Okay, I did not add it. So that's actually one of the things about GPT4 Mini.
0:22:48 Is it doesn't, it only does like one thing. And maybe it did it and I didn't apply it, so. Tap open.
0:23:01 Oh, so maybe I didn't accept it. Oh, that's what it is. I'm just not fully active. Alright, so let's go find Task, Poe Task Watch.
0:23:15 Perfect. Let's try it again. There you go. Umm, this Test Assist command. Okay, so let's see what the exit code, so that was our new.
0:23:40 Umm, so what we can do, set a breakpoint, and umm, normally we can debug.
0:23:59 Otherwise, not see this test. See, this is one of those things, challenge, uhh, just that I have with cursor, but it's fine, because we can just go to here.
0:24:10 Umm, that is that. Test assist, set a breakpoint, debug contest. System exit 2, name file path. Okay, let's see what the result is.
0:24:27 Okay, blueprint options, so we have to do options, because if you, if we go back and look at it, um, test assist.
0:24:57 Command, we go to SRC, Sunjin, commands assist. Oh, it, one of the things is it, it, um, it, sometimes acts strange when you don't, when you only have one command, so let's add a command.
0:25:19 So, we'll go to here. Um, we can do that through the CLI, but let's just do it through here. Um, and we're gonna say, um, we're gonna reset.
0:25:31 And we're gonna say, um, add a command. Uh, run, um, that will run a blueprint. And we'll just add the blueprint, uh, models.
0:25:53 Okay, run a hater blueprint.
0:26:03 Perfect. Perfect. So, um, that's not what we want. We can say, um, instead, um, instead of the current arg, change it to file path with the- the default being.
0:26:56 So now, let's give it another run. Okay, so, it's still, um, failing. on? And we'll say, um, echo, str, and we'll just f.
0:27:20 Perfect. Alright. So. So, Cool. So yeah, we-we have to, we-we push the test. Okay. I don't know why it's giving eggs a 2.
0:27:54 But we're not gonna be debugging this today. This is why we're making the code system. So. We'll just keep on, So we'll check the result one more time.
0:28:09 Usage. Error. Missing argument echo. Alright. So. Results okay.
0:28:30 Let's go back. Do you want me to pause?
0:28:50 I won't say anything. Let's just say. This. Let's just find out where our little okay is. Just so that we can match that.
0:29:17 It's a two-ball. Standard out. Result that output.
0:29:48 So this is not how it works. Oh, no. Hey, shake. Can I shake my carrot? Sorry, this sounds. Shake. I'm sorry.
0:30:16 You want me to hit? Do you want me to hit? Do yourself? Yes. Just need time to take it out.
0:30:47 So actually, let's get, let's try eight or no. Let's see if some of these shut up. I'm set up Dr.
0:30:54 Vogel. Let's actually create a code blueprint for this.
0:31:09 Alright, so what we'll do is we'll take this output. Take this. And, um, I'll clients, except them all.
0:31:29 Okay, so, um, need to make some changes, uh, since t-t 2.5, uh, came in. Um, this root predict. Interesting. So, this is just me doing some testing.
0:31:45 So let's go to the code blueprint. Alright. So now we're saying, this, let's just see if from this, it can detect what's going on.
0:31:55 So, code blueprint command, it's got the command, the tests that command that's getting run, we don't have the file that this is defined in.
0:32:05 . . So we'll say, um, define in, uh, copy path reference, um, path from content, from source root.
0:32:18 No. Content root, because we're going to be running it in repository root. That's what it is, because that's what we're going to be running.
0:32:25 Alright. So what we're going to say is, um, create a basic code blueprint to fix. Let's see what it comes up with.
0:32:40 Um, so just to recap, Dr. Vogel, I came up with this, um, I don't know what to call a specification or something like that, but basically called a code blueprint.
0:32:55 I'll go from the top. So it's basically, um, a way to group tasks or files to be edited or create.
0:33:04 We'll see in the next from coding tools like Adr. And so what we're going to be doing is, um, we're going to be, there's something called a code context file, which is kind of on the macro level.
0:33:20 So we're going to be basically bridging the two. Um, and we're going to be kind of generating using, um, sungen to generate modules.
0:33:30 Uh, because basically, I don't think that we're ever going to get to the point where, an AI can figure out your code just because versions will be different and style will be different and stuff of that.
0:33:44 So what I think it'll be is that you'll have to build an entire code generator around your code base, which I guess could be done by an AI, which it will be done by an AI.
0:33:56 But it's a different paradigm, right? Like, it isn't just I'm going to be able to run a CLI. Well, I mean, one of generates everything you will be.
0:34:03 We'll just say the current paradigm by the current . . AI assistants, I don't think we'll scale. So we're coming at it from the other angle.
0:34:10 So let's see what we have coming generated. Alright, so what do we have? Um, failure and test blueprint command by fixing the output .
0:34:22 . current output running blueprint hello world. So a data match output subcommand blueprint, right? So even . . . in here, this isn't exactly what we want.
0:34:34 Want? So we have the message. Um, and so this is where we're expecting it to run the output of the test.
0:34:44 So, um, and again, one of the things about this, and actually I don't even . . we'll run it and then abandon it.
0:34:50 Cause this is kind of a trivial example. But then again, also an example of, like, how complicated it is just to describe something, uh, not working.
0:35:00 So here, and here it went into actually fixing the issue. What it thinks . . . fixing the issue. . What it looks like.
0:35:06 But let's run this blueprint. So we go to our, um, assist command. And then . . . All right, kit assist command will run the blueprint in the file.
0:35:26 So we'll just make this, uh . . . yaml. So in here we'll create new file blueprint. print. . . yaml. Um . . . And then I'm running a custom version of Adir that has a fix in it.
0:35:46 Um . . . We'll just make sure. Well, let's, let's run the one that's in here. I think, I don't know if it's the one I may touch or not, but whatever.
0:35:56 We will, um . . I think there's a way that I can tell. So we can go, uh, Adir, uh, version . . . Okay, so this is the, the Adir, the, the normal version.
0:36:10 So we're gonna be using the, um . . . the model as GPT-40 mini, for instance, and we'll see how it works. Um .
0:36:21 . . So we go . . . So . . . See ya. Assist, run, and see what happens. Okay. So it didn't echo anything. Um . . . Oh, that's because it didn't do anything.
0:36:40 Okay, so we have our, um . . . think it's in the . . . actually in the Hater project. So I have my . . I pulled down the Hater project.
0:36:49 Do a quick attach. Oh, you can't do that. Quick attach. Where is it? Attach. We'll go to dev. Hater. You can see, like, how it was creating all these files.
0:37:04 miles. Blueprints. Then we have this . . . oh, we're just attaching the Hater project, sorry. Um . . we're attaching Hater. Okay. So, um .
0:37:19 . Hater, if . . . you see how it does this stuff, this is because . . . when you're doing GPT-4, it takes it very literally.
0:37:30 Um . . . so actually what we can do is we can do, um . . . poetry. tree. Move Hater chat. Okay. It's not installed.
0:37:41 In the project, we can do, uh, uninstall . . . yes. Okay. So then what we'll do is we'll go to Hater. And let's just make sure that we have that change that I was talking about.
0:38:01 We go to Hater, go to Models, and let's just make sure that we have . . Mini . . . has a whole file . . . . . . sorry guys.
0:38:16 Okay. Yeah. Whole file editor. Cool. Alright. So that's, that's correct. Then we need to go to the whole file. The editor is in the coders.
0:38:27 Whole file coder. Uhm, prompts. So, um . . This is . . Oh, this functional prompts. Whole file prompts. Okay. So in here I had to do a get the get root, and then you see how it does path to example here.
0:38:46 Um, I had to do this thing where I say that replaced path to with the get root. So . . . you . . your results with editor may not be the same.
0:38:56 So . . . . . . probably won't be. But maybe it will. I don't know. Um, alright. So now what we can do is . . . since we're in here .
0:39:06 . we can do pip install e . . . hopefully this works. Okay. So you can see editor chat . . . 0.01. So let's go back into sun gen.
0:39:30 You can do, um, editor version . . . Okay, uhm, not found. I think it's oh, uhm, pip install . . . d e . . . . slash editor .
0:39:56 . . Okay. So this is, now, we're in the . . . The version of Python . . where we have . . Okay, unsolved . . . Okay, so yeah, I have Adir in here, um, but it should have it .
0:40:21 . . Oh, okay . . . Okay. So let's just say Adir . . . Okay, so it's broken . . . Alright. Uh . . Well, let's uninstall . . . Alright, we're not doing it either.
0:41:06 Oh, a I journey. We're doing our own DSPY version. Alright, perfect. Okay, so if we're doing that, then this is perfect.
0:41:16 Right? No longer . . . can no longer use their version. So . . what we're gonna do now is we will, um, separate the command from the execution.
0:41:29 So . . . we'll go here and we'll go to assist. and what we're doing. What gonna do is we're gonna actually do this.
0:41:39 We're gonna say, uh, def run equals underscore run. Right? Because what I wanna do is I wanna separate the, um .
0:41:50 . . the logic from the actual execution. I mean from the . . the CLI command. Basically, the thing that I want is I want it so that, um .
0:42:01 . . you're not . . . you're doing . . . you're checking the variables here. And, um . . you're doing the work over here. So for instance here, I don't have to worry about file path because .
0:42:14 . . file path will be coming in through here. And also we can say, um . . . equals . . . path. Um, we can do type er .
0:42:24 . . path. . . file. Um . . . let's see this. Let's do this. Um . . . change the . . . run. To use the . . . It works. So then, what we should be able to do is, um, we'll open up my blueprint.
0:43:14 Uh, this is not how you do it. Blueprint. Oh, we only have eight or blueprint in here. We can, does this?
0:43:46 Yeah, this is not the right version. So what we can do is we'll go back, um, to our chat. We'll go back and grab.
0:43:55 Okay, so we're in the sun-gen.
0:44:17 Where is it? So, now we've got Blueprint in here. So now we can do, um, bp equals.
0:44:35 tools. I don't know if that's how the yaml mixing works, do you know what?
0:44:57 Yaml tools yaml mixing from yaml is the actual correct one. Alright, so now we can go here. And we'll do Sunjin.
0:45:39 Assist, run. Okay. So, uh, oh, Blueprint.
0:45:50 Oh, Blueprint. Subtract. Subtract. Alright. Sorry. It's assist. Wait. Sunjin. and Okay.
0:46:30 Umm, I messed up. Okay. Yeah. Dog isn't having a rough time. Okay.
0:46:42 Umm, serve call. WOAH! Shh. Shh. That should be- it should still be fine. Okay. Perfect. Okay. So, umm, Typer has no thing path.
0:47:05 Okay. Typer file path. There you go. Oh yeah! So, actually one- what you're seeing here is um, this error analysis- so I actually- this is cool.
0:47:19 Um, I- I created in the CLI command. This thing where- if there's a global error, we handle it.
0:47:32 And it actually goes to the language model. And runs it. . . And you can see error analysis and fix suggestions. So that's what this is.
0:47:44 So, type our file path. So again, this is the- the thing about, you know, even in cursor, the GPT-40-mini isn't trustworthy.
0:48:00 Which is good that I have a- a double check. File path. . . . Maybe that's . . . not defined. Let's . . . ok, now let's mess it up.
0:48:27 Let's mess it up. So, let's go to the GPT-40. And so, this is exactly why I'm doing this. And it's hard, and it would be way easier, and also way more .
0:48:38 . expensive to do this with, um, GPT-4. But, you know, the people, a lot of people can't really afford . . for . . . or whatever.
0:48:49 So, here it's doing the blueprint. We just need something that, um, is normal. Oh yeah, we got the new models out there, but we'll just do four.
0:49:01 We'll say, um, can you fix . . . . . . Okay, so yeah, it's, Oh . . . recursive . . . ok. So, let's see what the correct version looks like .
0:49:20 . . . ok. So, it's doing argument which is not . . what we want . . and so it's, I . . . . , . wanted to validate the file that exists.
0:49:37 So, even still, here . . it's not doing what I want it to do . . . right? It still doesn't get the picture. So, this is exactly why we're coming at it from this high level perspective and drilling down .
0:49:51 . . because I think that's . . . ok. See, so, Typer has a way to do this . . . umm, Typer . . . . and so, this is a perfect example where, like, for instance, I needed to look up .
0:50:03 . . um, but also, I haven't told it what I want . . you know, that's all those things . . . where does it learn . . . um, path .
0:50:20 . . ok, so here's . . . here's what it is . . . file paths . . . ok . . . so, optional . . . but we'll just start off with . . . um . . . see, so it's even .
0:50:37 . it's way simpler . . then even any of this stuff . . . so, go back here . . . and, like, who knows if this stuff . . . like, what this stuff even is .
0:50:50 . . so . . . final . . . now, the reason why it's using this old version of the code is they have this thing called the, um .
0:50:59 . . shadow DOM . . . so, path . . . equals . . . . . . yeah, let's go back . . sorry guys . . um, . so let's just start here . . . now we're on track .
0:51:26 . . path . . . and code . . this takes path . . . um . . from YAML . . . which is the YAML code . . and it creates an instance of the pyaniic model.
0:51:42 Yeah, and the CLS is itself . . . um . . . and so it shows the string, but it'll . . string . . . it'll change it to a path .
0:51:51 . so anyway, let's go back to here . . . . ok, perfect . . so I read the blueprint . . . . and again, still wrong information . . so we'll have to figure that out as well .
0:52:11 . . . alright, so let's . . let's run it . . . . . what we need to do is . . and we'll just start building this . . . um, from scratch .
0:52:22 . so let's start with . . . actually, in the ADOR project, I have . . . . how to run it . . so what we're going to grab is we're just going to grab how ADOR runs this file .
0:52:35 . . the blueprints . . this create command . . . because here it has, um, the logic . . so, you know, for instance, file creation, if it doesn't exist .
0:52:48 . . you know, auto-test all this stuff . . so we're just going to take . . . all of this . . . and we're going to strip out the ADOR parts .
0:52:57 . . hopefully, we'll get it to work . . . . and actually what we can do is we can just leave that there as reference .
0:53:05 . so we can say . . 4 . . . to create . . . we can say . . . create the files . . . let's see if this works . . . ok . . . so here, for instance, it didn't do the .
0:53:34 . . um . . didn't do the . . space correctly . . alright . . alright guys . . . you're watching me learn, in real time . . . alright . . . alright . . now we have to create the files if it does not exist .
0:54:07 . . ok . . . so, let's . . . um . . . actually let's create a . . . duplicate of this situation . . . um . . so what we'll do is we'll create a new command .
0:54:23 . what we'll call it . . . . . create . . . okay . . . so now we have this create command . . and so, um . . . actually, what we can do is .
0:54:54 . . we can take this and create a blueprint of it . . . so what we'll do is . . . have the . . . . . . I have a blueprint .
0:55:07 . . code blueprint, uhh, gpt . . okay, so what we're going to say is, we're just going to take what's already here. Now one of the things that is going to be like a philosophy of mine is always using code generator first.
0:55:23 And so that's another aspect of . . . code assistant that we're trying to make is that the code assistant I actually wanted to make templates, not fixed bugs .
0:55:34 . . which is actually what we're doing right now. But we're building the code generator . . context, that's what we're working on. We have to get some tools going for that.
0:55:43 So, um, we're creating the context. Um, so actually, you know what? We're going to make it get it to the point where we can create these context files.
0:55:54 We're not going to worry about the . . . well, we're going to get to the generators first, then we'll get to fixing files and stuff like that.
0:56:01 That, I think will work. Cause otherwise you can go down a rabbit hole of, uh, all that other kind of stuff.
0:56:09 That's all right. The whole thing, right? The, there's a book that I like thin air, where it talks about like nanotechnology and things like that, where he says, you know, no matter what it is, it's always faster and cheaper to build it from scratch than it is to change what's already there.
0:56:27 So, that's going to be the philosophy. There you go. That's the first philosophy of the DSPY code generator. So, um.
0:56:36 So, let's go tell the AI that. I think that's a good thing. . . . to start working on. So, we're going to go to the code context.
0:56:44 Code-based context. And what we're going to say is, um, I would like to create a code generator that first generates code-based context files.
0:56:58 Period. One of the philosophies of this generator code assistant is that it always builds everything from scratch. It does. do not edit existing files.
0:57:15 Why might I have that philosophy? Yeah. Exactly. That's one of the things is that even if your editor, for instance, or your agent zero, or your whatever, even if the unit tests pass, can you trust that code that it created?
0:57:52 No matter what, you're always going to have to check it. Whereas if you trust your code generators, you don't have to check it because it's generated at the same time.
0:58:01 So yeah, infrastructure is code mindset. Continuous delivery-friendly. Yeah, so exactly. We're making the actual creation of the code, like the CI-CD pipeline, because that's what that is.
0:58:18 And that actually I think makes perfect sense. And also we're getting, in terms of complexity of the tools, closer and closer to that.
0:58:26 Right? Um. So yeah, so that's what we're going to do. So now, what we're going to do is, we're going to give it the blueprint.
0:58:36 Actually, we're going to take the code-based context and turn it into Python. I'd end this model. So that's what we're going to do first.
0:58:41 So let's go to the code-based context. I've got too many. Okay, we've got code-based context. And so, what we're going to do is we're going to generate the context prompt.
0:58:53 And actually, instead of generating, um, on Titanic models first, actually, I think that would be easier because then we could do DSPI signatures, but I think understand stampede active model stress.
0:59:07 Let's continue. Invert the machine readable parts of the code-based context into pedantic models. Because I have something that uses structured outputs.
0:59:23 So, um, we'll do that first. Yeah, we'll get the code-based context generating. Then, because that's the thing, is imagine if I can generate 100 code context files, instantly, we can feed that into code generators.
0:59:40 . Right? Okay. So, one of the things we need to do is we're gonna say, um, I need to have verbose dockstrings for the class.
0:59:51 Period. Do not put the arguments in the class dockstring. Each attribute of the model needs to have a field with a description.
1:00:10 That provides context to another code generator. Right? Gotta eat our own dog food. So, we don't need this e-mail extra and so, uh, no examples.
1:00:27 So, it's gonna take its time, whatever. See, it already stopped. Didn't pay attention. And we'll do it in all caps.
1:00:45 Do not put the argument attributes. Did you say attributes or argu- attributes? Oh, and I put the K in there.
1:01:01 Again. Even GPT4 not following directions.
1:01:18 So, and then it's still not following directions. Because also we'll be able to turn these pedantic models into signatures if we want to.
1:02:03 Which is actually probably what we'll want to do anyway. I have a really cool method of doing concurrent, uh, signatures as well.
1:02:09 That is That is all right. I might get into. But this is also good because this allows us to have our code assistant not be in the business of making working code.
1:02:20 We can leave that to the very, very end. So, for instance, we can have it make diagrams. You know, all of these really interesting kind of pieces.
1:02:54 Alright, so now we have a really well documented, um, piece here so then we can go to here. And we have that command that got created.
1:03:06 Now one of the things is I'm creating commands here. But I also have for Sanjin and- entire plug-in system. So you can see actually I was starting the blueprints as a plug-in.
1:03:16 But right now we're gonna keep it simple to where it's a command. And then if we want to, we can make it into a, um.
1:03:26 Sorry, make it into a, um. Plug-in later. Alright, so actually we need to change our template. So it's def. Def create.
1:03:39 8. Alright, so then we have in here, our models here. Um, so we have a new file and we're gonna call it code context.
1:04:04 So we have our, our code context. Alright, cool. So, I can already look- at this and know that with GPT4 this is way too big for it to create.
1:04:16 So what we're gonna do is we need to come up with a signature that describes each one of these. So what we're gonna do is f- we're not gonna go into these first.
1:04:29 What we're gonna do is we're gonna grab this and we're gonna go to our signature generator. Which is one of my numerous, um, GPTs.
1:04:41 Alright, and we're gonna say, um, I need one signature that generates the requirements for each one of these arguments and attributes.
1:05:02 Let's see if it's able to figure that out. Okay, so. Input. So, we'll be able to change that. Um. Perfect.
1:05:25 Yeah. And so, what we can do is, we'll say also that, um, even though the output field is there, it's, um, here it's making, yeah.
1:05:41 So, this is not what we, so the thing is what we're saying is, um, we are going to be giving epics from a JIRA issue and need to have the context file created from that text period.
1:06:09 Also, in the, uh, the output description include, on average, how many of the things will be created and mention whether or not it'll be a list.
1:06:21 Period. But keep the input fields and output fields that just have descriptions. Right, I don't, I don't want it to all of a sudden be putting different kinds of, it's construction here.
1:06:38 And we can just put desk. Yeah. See, so yeah, we're going to change the gear, ehm, epics, right. We're going to give it a bunch of stories and you know, we're going to say what the executives want.
1:07:06 And then we're going to create the code-based context based on that. I think that will work well. Cool, so let's now say that, um.
1:07:21 Oh, I know what we're going to do. We're going to go to the con-code-based, because let's go check the read-me of the specification, because what they have here is a linter, and let's now change it to a template generator, something like that, right.
1:07:36 So, um. We're just going to grab all this. Right? And we're going to say, um. Do this. Sorry, I got so many screens.
1:07:51 Let's, let's start chopping these down. That's the one we're working on. This, this. I've been very busy. We got a lot of really cool stuff coming up, so we just need to get through these basics, and then.
1:08:10 Perfect. Alright. . . . So what we're going to say is, um, now, uh, convert this to the epics for a code-based context generator.
1:08:28 Start simple. Yup. Okay, so it's not, uh, no.
1:08:55 Uh, context library, that'll be interesting. So no, it's, it's, uh, uh, no. It's, um, generator. So we can say linter, linter is already done.
1:09:10 So let's just say that we, we are just working on the generator. No other projects are in scope.
1:09:26 Talk to it like a product manager. So, we're, we're, it's interesting, right? Okay, populated version from reading from package managers.
1:09:54 That's a good one. I like that. Advanced context generation. And so, what's good is that here, one of the things that we want to kind of notice is it's talking about, we're going to be giving that information to it.
1:10:11 So. Now, we just need a meta, we'll call it a meta generator, that handles this next level. Umm, and we'll leave that.
1:10:22 So, because that's the thing is we want the meta generator. We want to be able to, to say from very, umm, very limited text just to get us started.
1:10:32 So, we're going to say, umm, we want a meta generator that will take a couple of sentences. Yes. Yes. This is, and generate all of the requirements for the generator above.
1:10:50 Period. The meta generator will use large language models to generate the text and diagrams using mermaid.js.
1:11:07 And C4 DSL. . Yeah. Perfect. Now the meta generator is what we actually wanted. Umm, so let's see if we can create the epics.
1:11:36 Oh, cool. So actually it went straight for the signature. So it's fun- So finally is actually the signature is kind of the- the example of- it's very similar to that.
1:11:51 So- so it's actually- but yeah, see, a di- it generates a diagram, it denivates a DSL. This is perfect, right?
1:12:00 So now we've got the meta generator. So now we connect the meta generator. So then actually it lets- . Well, this- we- we can just give it as the epic.
1:12:14 So this- this output, we can turn into the epic. So then let's take, uhm, we'll say, uhm, create- create a ginger template.
1:12:34 This is actually a pattern I was thinking about. Template that converts the- result. The response. Outputs. of generate requirements.
1:12:57 And, uhm, converts them. So this is actually an intermediate step that we don't need. Oh, well, no, actually we need this for the code generation.
1:13:10 So this is a good- we're now getting into- Thank you. This is actually exactly what I was talking about, right?
1:13:14 We go signature to template generator, and then we're gonna go to signature, but we can also do, um, well, I have the entire DSL as well, but we're gonna work with the class version for right now.
1:13:27 But that's how we're gonna really scale this up. Um, alright. So we create the just- the response outputs generate and converts, um.
1:13:42 Get into the JIRA, JIRA epics for the- generate project horn. It's interesting. Let's see how it works.
1:14:24 No, so this is- this is not correct. So let's go back a second. So we'll- we'll say here, user stories.
1:14:34 Yeah, product description, user stories, workflow diagram, architecture diagram. Okay, so- so the- um, oh, well yeah, it's mermaid. So this is actually correct.
1:14:46 And if we don't need this explanation of template, so let's- let's kind of start breaking this down. So we're gonna have, um, what are we gonna call it?
1:14:57 We're gonna call it, um, epic template. We have, um, epic TMPL. And we're just gonna delete. We'll see in the next So we have our JIRA templates, right?
1:15:26 This epics, we don't have this anywhere. So we're gonna just say, um.
1:15:44 We'll just call this user story. And then the, yeah, the, the epic will be described. Here, perfect. Okay, so now let's just create in here a main function.
1:16:01 Um. And I have some custom libraries, which is why I'm, um. Um, Not going to be using, um, cursor right now?
1:16:19 Okay, so, We got the llama, we're gonna switch to DSPy, which reminds me, we need to switch, well, actually no, it, it, it's already, um, 2.5, because it's complaining, if you remember already complaining about something.
1:16:38 Alright, we got our init DSPy, so what we're gonna do, U is, we're gonna take our signature back up here, not here, our signature here, back up here, and we're gonna say, um, generate requirements.
1:16:57 Right? And so, we have our, uh, we'll just put it, template above it. Okay. And we'll import. . Alright, cool. There we have our imports.
1:17:16 So then we have our, um, I had, like, uh, I created some new utilities. Um, let's go find them.
1:17:27 D-s. That's not it. Utilities. D-s by tools. Alright, so we got this predict type. It was a bunch of, like, typed stuff.
1:17:39 Um, and it predict type. pipe. But our string runs predict returns this specified output argument. Right. Um, predict types.
1:17:52 That wasn't it. This is some cool stuff with the, uh, so let's just make, um, uh, death predict. Sick. And we'll just say, um, input.
1:18:09 Dictionary. So actually, we'll do it this way. So, take this, we'll delete this. What we'll do is we'll grab all this, and we'll just put it down here, and say, um, I would like function called, um, and we'll go grab the- signature from the DSPY here, and we'll say, um, yeah, uh, actually, yeah, we'll
1:18:59 grab this, and we'll say, uh, because I just want to make it, like, super, not dumb, but, you'll see, um, that.
1:19:12 You can take a, uhm, we also need, uhm, we need a particular sig, because I want it to be, like, really, um, basic.
1:19:31 So, it can take a signature class or string, uh, a input, um, uh, string, or dict, and return the forward.
1:20:02 We'll just see what it creates. I just want, like, one function I can just run. Let's see how it designs it.
1:20:28 So you can just give it a signature, and then put data as a type or a string, and it just handles it.
1:20:47 And we'll start here. And we can, we'll just, let's just start chopping this up. Because we don't want to return a dictionary, we want to return.
1:21:04 Well, no, that, it's always a dictionary. Um, but we just wanted to return the output. So, um. . . Let's, um, let's always assume one.
1:21:26 And this will make it easier once we get to the yaml versions of this. Assume one output. And, um, no typed predictors.
1:21:57 Okay, and so we don't want the dictionary, and we'll say, um, you know, just return the, uh, um, what does it look like, um, pre-dot, dot.
1:22:08 Uh, I think it's like, Thank much for in the get ATR. Oh yeah, get attribute, and it's so, um, I'll put fields.
1:22:25 Uh, we'll see how it works. Uh, I need to let the dot go. So, cause I've actually done this before.
1:23:12 Cause we have the output. Key? Umm, no. No, to get the output key and return that string.
1:24:24 Yeah, this should be exactly what we need. So let's give it a shot. Perfect signature. Oh, I already had one?
1:24:37 Oh, no, it's because there's a bad one. I'll just, We got it pretty sick, and then we can go grab the mains.
1:24:54 Yeah, we can do it in the main. And actually we can use a llama. See how that works. Maybe it works better now.
1:25:04 Like, Okay, cool. Oh, it's already, Doesn't need to resolve itself if it's already there. So let's see. . Okay, that worked.
1:25:31 So then we got our, umm, our second main. So we'll just do, uhh, main two. Okay, so I didn't find the output field.
1:26:07 Let's just find the output field ourselves. Okay, so we got our signature.
1:26:28 When we look at it. Field, DSPY field type. Umm. Yeah, it's, so a signature.
1:26:51 It's a signature meta. Come new. Let's see. See you. fields, items. Okay, that's what we need, model fields, items. And we'll go and check it.
1:27:51 We'll just, uhh, uhh, uhh, not return anything for right now.
1:28:19 And we'll say, signature. And we'll say, umm, print, name, field.
1:28:39 And we'll just do, to end it, print, hello. And we can just stop. Perfect. Alright, field info. Annotations required. DSPY, field type.
1:29:01 So we can say, umm. And we'll say, umm. The . . . . And instead of, like, complaining, we'll just take the . . . ah, So we'll say, uhh, field .
1:29:23 . . umm. DSPY, field . . . type . . . is . . what I think we'll do, umm, if . . . type . . is output . . . . output . . . key. That's what we call it up there.
1:30:01 Now, equals . . field . . . and that should be name . . . name . . . name . . and then we say, um, and then we already have it, so then we just return, um, because we've already done the prediction.
1:30:40 We do the prediction here. Yeah, we do the prediction . . and then we just return, uh, prediction . . . get, uh, name . . . . There we go.
1:30:57 Let's see if that works. Else, um, else . . I mean, then it's otherwise raise value error. Uh, something, uh, so . . It's like, output .
1:31:19 . . not . . . Oh no, it should just have an output, whatever. So, there we go. Alright. Cool. So we stop . . . Oh, okay, so yeah, is .
1:31:38 . . I've been doing Python for a while, I always forget whether or not it's . . . if or . . Alright, console . . . okay, field info .
1:32:01 . . that's strange . . . field . . . . . . what was that . . . okay, JSON schema extra . . . okay, that might be what we look at . . . oh, it's hidden because it's .
1:32:36 . . okay, we'll just do that . . . uhh . . . get . . . play rate 7 appearances. experiences. Perfect. So now, I have something where I can just go back here, and while I'm playing around, just go in and say, alright, um, predict, um, what was it, SIG?
1:33:37 And we can just say, um, generate requirements, and, our input . . Data is . . um, where is it? I'll go back up here.
1:33:56 To our other conversation. We were talking to it about . . . oops . . . code-based context . . . Where is it? Okay, here it is. I guess .
1:34:42 . it was . . . All right. So, what's All right. All right. Did you erase the history? No. No. Okay. Metagenorator requirements creation.
1:34:55 Yeah. Here we go. All right. So then when we say, um . . . Go in here, and we just say, um . . And we just say, um .
1:35:24 . . What are we calling it? Well wait, so if we're doing generate requirements, it generates a whole bunch of stuff. So we don't want just this one.
1:35:33 What was it up here creating? Oops. So, we'll just do . . . Oh. Instead of that . . . um . . . We'll just do this . . . 3 .
1:35:50 . And up here we'll do . . . oops . . . Yeah . . . 3 . . . actually what we want, we did want it to provide the dictionary of outputs.
1:36:14 Um . . and put, uh, predict, uh, sig . . . actually what we can do, do we have predict . . . I think I had predict types .
1:36:32 . . string string . . . okay, yeah, so . . . so what we want, actually, yeah, we have type . . . okay, we just want dict. That's what it is.
1:36:43 So we already had predict string . . . we're just messing around with dict. So . . we want to do is just . . . return the prediction .
1:36:56 . . here is class . . . and we're just . . . it doesn't matter what it is . . we're just going to return the dict . . . . There we go.
1:37:19 Alright. Well, it does predict . . . oops . . . we're just going to worry about this one. Output . . and we're just going to say .
1:37:46 . . . . h equals . . . dspi . . . output field . . . . desk. And we're actually going to even need to put the field, so we'll just say .
1:38:00 . . dict . . . result . . . prediction . . . and so we can do a result . . . um, age . . . 21 . . . answer . . . there we go. Perfect. Okay, so now we have the dictionary that outputs .
1:38:40 . . predict . . dict . . and then we'll say . . . X equals . . . print . . . print . . . . Alright, result is we didn't change the file when we were doing context.
1:39:29 This is where we're debugging. Input must be a dictionary. No, that's not what we want. That's not what we want.
1:39:52 We want it to be a string. Cuz the input will be a string. Let's see who jumped in. Maybe they jumped out already.
1:40:05 I don't know what those sounds mean. Maybe one day I'll learn those sounds. No, we got S-P-D-E-37. What's up? I'm not a predict model.
1:40:20 Umm. Well, we have string if we're doing string, so this'll be, one of the input data could be a string.
1:40:36 So if it's string, we have one input. Yeah. Uhm. So if we have string, sub class signature does, So we can say, if, if this is a dictionary, um, we, no matter what we, we set up the signature with the class, then if it's a dictionary, we do this, the... else, if, predict, prediction, equals, umm, predict
1:41:33 model, umm, and it's, the keyword argument is, the input data? You know, the, yeah, the keyword argument, so the, umm, so we'll say, uh, quarn.
1:41:59 Yeah, quarn, equals a dict, where, the, I don't know how to do this with, can you do this with a dictionary?
1:42:15 Let's see. Name of value pairs, Because what we want is, Oh!
1:42:36 Oh, I know! Yeah, with, what it is, is this. The key is the, umm, the input, The key.
1:42:47 So, we'll do, It's the reverse of this. I should stop playing around with this. Umm, Alright, so we'll just do the, the normal, umm, the normal way of doing this.
1:43:07 So, we'll just do, umm, So that's one of those things, right? There's like, I've been playing around with it, and it hasn't been working, so we'll just do predict.
1:43:16 And we'll do, . Uhh, project description, equals this. Umm, equals, uhh, what was it? We were calling it, input string or something?
1:43:32 Yeah, input, string, .forward. Why are we getting that here? Signature unfilled. Oh! Yeah, sorry. It's, this part is general requirements.
1:43:57 And this part is this. Alright. So now, playing around too much. But that's fine, right? The, I say playing around too much, but at the same time I'm learning the restrictions, the requirements, we're gonna delete that.
1:44:19 . We're also learning the limitations of myself as a program. And why we're building tools. In the first place. I'm doing it so that you don't have to.
1:44:29 So what we're gonna do is we're just gonna delete, this anyway. Delete that. Delete that. Okay. Yeah, we're just gonna use this.
1:44:42 Cause, I mean, I already have the DSL. I have all this stuff. One of the things also is that I have so many, tools that I've already built that determining which ones to use is a challenge in of itself.
1:44:54 And it's, uh, let's try it again. Just thinking about it. Uh, thinking about it.
1:45:25 Oh, okay. No, yeah, that's okay. Great. So what it was doing, perfect. So now we got a, Oh, great. Yeah.
1:45:31 No, this is perfect. It really, it really went. Okay, so let's, let's, we got generated requirements. Functional requirements. Detect project dependencies.
1:45:45 Build dot gradle. Output directory. Generate user story diagrams and workflows. Yeah, uh, workflow diagram.
1:45:58 So we can, uh, awesome. So let's just grab this. And instead of this, um, we can just do, um, oops.
1:46:13 Not that. Okay, now we have our requirements. Dictionary, right? So we paste this down. Instead, we say, um, this. This.
1:46:25 This. This. This. This. This. Actually, we have a munch. This allows us to do JavaScript style. Uh, so we'll say, Rex equals munch.
1:46:44 Munch. Do this. Do this. All right, now we have an appropriate munch. We're gonna fill the paragraph. Fill the paragraph.
1:47:02 And so what we're gonna do is we're going to go check to see if these, um, work. So we're gonna print out the workflow diagram.
1:47:13 So, um, So. . . . .

Creating an APS to Typer CLI: A Step-by-Step Guide with Code Examples
Introduction
In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating a Typer CLI application that parses Agile Protocol Specification (APS) files and performs actions based on their content. We will use Pydantic models to represent the APS structures and Typer to build the command-line interface.

This project aims to:

Convert APS documents into a machine-readable format using YAML.
Define Pydantic models to validate and manipulate APS data.
Create a Typer CLI that allows users to interact with APS files through command-line commands.
By the end of this guide, you will have a functional CLI tool that can read APS YAML files, validate them against Pydantic models, and provide useful commands for working with APS documents.

Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.7 or higher
pip package manager
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install typer pydantic ruamel.yaml
Typer: For building the CLI application.
Pydantic: For data validation using models.
ruamel.yaml: For YAML parsing and serialization.
Understanding APS
Agile Protocol Specification (APS) is a structured language designed to specify agile processes, workflows, roles, activities, tasks, and scenarios in a clear and standardized way.

APS documents can be represented in YAML format for machine readability. An example APS YAML file might look like this:

yaml
Copy code
process:
  name: "User Authentication Feature Development"
  description: "Development process for the user authentication feature."
  roles:
    - name: "Product Manager"
      description: "Defines the feature requirements."
    - name: "Developer"
      description: "Implements the feature."
    - name: "Tester"
      description: "Validates the feature."
  activities:
    - name: "Feature Implementation"
      description: "Implement the authentication feature."
      tasks:
        - name: "Design Authentication Module"
          description: "Design the architecture of the authentication module."
        - name: "Develop Login Functionality"
          description: "Code the login functionality."
        - name: "Write Unit Tests"
          description: "Write unit tests for the authentication module."
Our goal is to create a CLI tool that can read such APS YAML files, validate them, and perform actions based on their content.

Setting Up the Project
Create a new directory for the project and initialize it:

bash
Copy code
mkdir aps_cli
cd aps_cli
Initialize a Python module:

bash
Copy code
touch aps_cli.py
Create a directory for models:

bash
Copy code
mkdir models
touch models/__init__.py
Defining Pydantic Models for APS
We will define Pydantic models to represent the APS structures. Each model will have fields with descriptions to provide context.

Create a file models/aps_models.py and add the following code:

python
Copy code
# models/aps_models.py

from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class Comment(BaseModel):
    text: str = Field(..., description="Comment text.")

class Localization(BaseModel):
    language: str = Field("en", description="Language code for localization.")

class DocString(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the doc string.")
    content: str = Field(..., description="Multiline content of the doc string.")

class DataTable(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the data table.")
    headers: List[str] = Field(..., description="List of header names.")
    rows: List[List[str]] = Field(..., description="List of rows, each row is a list of values.")

class DataStructures(BaseModel):
    data_tables: Optional[List[DataTable]] = Field(None, description="List of data tables.")
    doc_strings: Optional[List[DocString]] = Field(None, description="List of doc strings.")

class Step(BaseModel):
    type: str = Field(..., description="Type of step (Given, When, Then, And, But).")
    description: str = Field(..., description="Description of the step.")

class Scenario(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the scenario.")
    steps: List[Step] = Field(..., description="List of steps in the scenario.")

class Task(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the task.")
    description: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Description of the task.")

class Activity(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the activity.")
    description: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Description of the activity.")
    tasks: Optional[List[Task]] = Field(None, description="List of tasks within the activity.")

class Role(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the role.")
    description: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Description of the role and responsibilities.")

class Process(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the process.")
    description: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="High-level description of the process.")
    roles: Optional[List[Role]] = Field(None, description="List of roles involved in the process.")
    activities: Optional[List[Activity]] = Field(None, description="List of activities in the process.")
    scenarios: Optional[List[Scenario]] = Field(None, description="List of scenarios illustrating the process.")
    data_structures: Optional[DataStructures] = Field(None, description="Data structures used in the process.")
    annotations: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None, description="List of tags or annotations.")
    comments: Optional[List[str]] = Field(None, description="List of comments.")
    localization: Optional[Localization] = Field(None, description="Localization settings.")
These models correspond to the APS structures and will help us validate and manipulate APS data.

Creating the Typer CLI Application
In aps_cli.py, we will set up the Typer application and implement the CLI commands.

python
Copy code
# aps_cli.py

import typer
from typing import Optional
from ruamel.yaml import YAML
from models.aps_models import Process

app = typer.Typer()
yaml = YAML(typ='safe')

@app.command()
def validate(file: str):
    """
    Validate an APS YAML file against the APS model.
    """
    try:
        with open(file, 'r') as f:
            data = yaml.load(f)
        process = Process(**data['process'])
        typer.echo("Validation successful!")
    except Exception as e:
        typer.echo(f"Validation failed: {e}")

@app.command()
def show(file: str, section: Optional[str] = typer.Argument(None)):
    """
    Display sections of the APS YAML file.
    """
    with open(file, 'r') as f:
        data = yaml.load(f)
    if section:
        if section in data['process']:
            typer.echo(f"{section.capitalize()}:")
            typer.echo(data['process'][section])
        else:
            typer.echo(f"Section '{section}' not found.")
    else:
        typer.echo(data['process'])

@app.command()
def generate(file: str, output: str):
    """
    Generate code or documentation based on the APS file.
    """
    # Placeholder for generation logic
    typer.echo(f"Generating output based on {file} into {output}...")
    # Implement code generation or documentation logic here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
This CLI application provides three commands:

validate: Validates an APS YAML file against the Pydantic models.
show: Displays sections of the APS YAML file.
generate: Generates code or documentation based on the APS file.
Implementing CLI Commands
Command: validate
The validate command reads an APS YAML file and attempts to parse it into the Process model. If successful, it confirms validation; otherwise, it reports errors.

python
Copy code
@app.command()
def validate(file: str):
    """
    Validate an APS YAML file against the APS model.
    """
    try:
        with open(file, 'r') as f:
            data = yaml.load(f)
        process = Process(**data['process'])
        typer.echo("Validation successful!")
    except Exception as e:
        typer.echo(f"Validation failed: {e}")
Usage:

bash
Copy code
python aps_cli.py validate aps_spec.yaml
Command: show
The show command displays sections of the APS YAML file. If a section is specified, it shows that section; otherwise, it displays the entire process.

python
Copy code
@app.command()
def show(file: str, section: Optional[str] = typer.Argument(None)):
    """
    Display sections of the APS YAML file.
    """
    with open(file, 'r') as f:
        data = yaml.load(f)
    if section:
        if section in data['process']:
            typer.echo(f"{section.capitalize()}:")
            typer.echo(data['process'][section])
        else:
            typer.echo(f"Section '{section}' not found.")
    else:
        typer.echo(data['process'])
Usage:

bash
Copy code
python aps_cli.py show aps_spec.yaml roles
Command: generate
The generate command is a placeholder for generating code or documentation based on the APS file.

python
Copy code
@app.command()
def generate(file: str, output: str):
    """
    Generate code or documentation based on the APS file.
    """
    # Placeholder for generation logic
    typer.echo(f"Generating output based on {file} into {output}...")
    # Implement code generation or documentation logic here
You can expand this command to perform code generation using templates or other tools.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
python aps_cli.py generate aps_spec.yaml output_directory
Testing the CLI Application
Sample APS YAML File
Create a sample APS YAML file named aps_spec.yaml with the following content:

yaml
Copy code
process:
  name: "User Authentication Feature Development"
  description: "Development process for the user authentication feature."
  roles:
    - name: "Product Manager"

        - type: "Then"
          description: "The user is granted access to the system."
  data_structures:
    data_tables:
      - name: "Valid User Credentials"
        headers:
          - "Username"

        rows:
          - ["alice", "password123"]
          - ["bob", "securepass"]
    doc_strings:
      - name: "Authentication Payload"
        content: |
          {
            "username": "alice",
            "password": "password123"
          }
  annotations:
    - "@authentication"
    - "@critical"
  comments:
    - "# Ensure all security requirements are met."

Conclusion
We have successfully created a Typer CLI application that:

Parses APS YAML files.
Validates them against Pydantic models.
Provides commands to interact with APS documents.
This tool can be extended further to generate code, documentation, or other artifacts based on the APS specifications. By using Pydantic for data validation and Typer for building the CLI, we have a robust foundation for working with APS in a programmatic way.

Rainbow specifies an abstract architecture model to validate run- time properties of the system, evaluate them against the model of constraint violations, and perform global- and module-level adapta- tions of the system [6]. SASSY (Self-architecting Software Systems) is a model-driven framework that, based on pre-defined software adaptation patterns, aims to accommodate requirement changes in a dynamic environment. It generates candidate software archi- tectures and selects the one that best serves stakeholder-defined, scenario-based quality-of-service (QoS) goals [27]. Finally, MUSIC provides a model-driven development approach combined with mid- dleware that facilitates dynamic and automatic adaptation based on adaptation concerns [13]. SASSY, MUSIC, and REACT are all based on the MAPE-K control loop principles.
Self-adaptation in SOA has been discussed in the literature [9, 12]. Existing works propose middleware that supports cross-layer adap- tation of SOA systems by considering the server-side perspec- tives [9]. This approach supports the adaptation of the service interface and application layer. It is based on a common meta- model of the two layers. Furthermore, dynamic self-adaptation in distributed service-oriented transactions [12] is an extension of the SASSY framework [27]. This extension proposes dynamic software adaptations in distributed transactions using a two-phase commit protocol. Specifically, it defines adaptation patterns and state machine models for transaction commits.
An automated approach for managing a collection of autonomic systems is based on the concept of a meta-manager that uses a parameterized adaptation policy [10, 11]. In this approach, a sys- tem is seen as composed of multiple constituent systems. Each constituent system contains a manager that keeps track of system metrics directly related to the overall system’s quality of service objectives. Each manager selects the actions that will improve the system’s performance. The approach implements a hierarchical control strategy that uses control theory to manage the behavior of the system while outsourcing decision-making responsibility to individual meta-manager units. However, this approach does not address the problem of structural changes in the application layer. Instead, it performs resource/capacity optimizations based on the runtime cost and response time analysis.
Based on the systematic mapping study [5], the state-of-the-art self-adaptive microservices-based systems focus on infrastructure layer adaptations [17, 25, 34] or multi-layer adaptations [9, 24, 37], while no studies address the problem of self-adaptation strategies in the application layer. Furthermore, there are works on reactive adap- tation strategies, in which adaptations are applied after problems are identified [17, 25, 34]. Proactive adaptation strategies have been proposed for scientific workflows [31] and IoT architectures [4]. Centralized monitoring has been practiced as the prominent adap- tation control mechanism [24, 34, 37].
The state-of-the-art studies on self-adaptive systems focus on the areas of cloud-based services, such as IoT and IaaS, rather than service-based software systems [36]. These approaches, which span across various domains (robotic, IoT, communication, automotive, e- commerce), utilize centralized monitoring, pre-defined models, and rule-based techniques [22, 36]. The introduction of self-managing and self-architecting principles in software systems could increase the sustainability of (micro)service-based architectures.
3 Service Colonies
A service colony is a system composed of software services, or inhab- itants, that interact with each other to perform specific functions. The inhabitants are deployed in a distributed computing environ- ment, such as a cloud, edge computing infrastructure, or IoT devices. Being intrinsically distributed, a service colony can exercise differ- ent levels of scatter in its control and decision-making capabilities across individual inhabitants, ranging from decentralized via divi- sional or hierarchical to centralized.
An inhabitant of a colony is responsible for performing some dedicated functionality, a service, within the system and exhibits a degree of autonomy. Hence, inhabitants within a colony may have diverse characteristics and capabilities, reflecting their differ- ent roles and responsibilities. Colony inhabitants have goals they aim to achieve and strive to optimize their performance and the performance of the overall system. Therefore, they are self- and situationally-aware entities. Inhabitants monitor their performance relative to their responsibilities, accepted service obligations, and the environment, and plan actions that ensure the desired quality of service. In doing so, they can proactively make decisions and take actions, such as replicating, migrating to another, more performant compute node, splitting into two entities, and seeking integration with another colony’s inhabitants. An inhabitant may rely on learn- ing mechanisms to improve their operations and decision rules based on prior experiences, allowing them to adapt and enhance their behavior.
An inhabitant can interact with other inhabitants and the envi- ronment. An inhabitant can request services from other inhabitants or provide service to them. In general, interaction patterns in a service colony can range from simple message exchanges between two inhabitants to complex collaboration protocols involving mul- tiple inhabitants and the environment. Through these interactions, inhabitants coordinate activities, exchange information, and take inputs from and return outputs of the system to the users.
The environment of a service colony comprises its inhabitants, the computing infrastructure utilized by the colony, and the com- munication channels that the colony inhabitants can exploit. As special components in the environment, we identify the users of the overall colony system. The users seek to accomplish tasks and functions by interacting with interface entities of the colony and receiving results of such requests. The users seek to accomplish tasks and functions by interacting with interface entities of the colony and receiving the results of such requests. The environment of a service colony is, thus, inherently dynamic and stochastic.
As opposed to a self-adaptive system, a service colony has de- centralized monitoring. In this proposed architecture, all the in- habitants act as autonomous agents. There is no special inhabitant responsible for overall communication, monitoring, or dynamic adaptations. Instead, each inhabitant can learn from its behavior and initiate actions to adjust the system automatically. Each in- dividual inhabitant of a service colony can be (sub-)optimal, but collectively, they aim to optimize the overall system performance. Figure 2 sketches an example composition of service inhabitants in a service colony. Arcs between inhabitants indicate the links used to support communications between the individuals. Inhabitants can communicate with other inhabitants, for example, via messages

passing through communication links. Analytical messages and behavioral messages are the two types of special messages sent to the environment. Each inhabitant can initiate a change in the colony based on its analysis of itself and the environment using ana- lytical messages. These can involve an inhabitant splitting, merging with another inhabitant, or adding or removing communication links between inhabitants. Furthermore, an inhabitant can send behavioral messages to the environment, indicating its capabili- ties or limitations. Examples of behavioral messages include the availability of more resources to be occupied by another inhabitant, delays in requests or responses, or the volume of data in requests or responses.
3.1 Inhabitant Characteristics
An inhabitant is the core building element of a service colony sys- tem. It encapsulates a delegated service, part of the functionality of the overall system, and monitors and proactively optimizes its performance. It is a self-contained entity. Each inhabitant has a boundary and a designated functionality that can be clearly distin- guished from other inhabitants. Inhabitants are autonomous agents that can act and react independently. Inhabitants have a dynamic state that can change over time. Inhabitants have a state that can change over time. The future actions taken by an inhabitant depend on its current state. Inhabitants can share their state with other in- habitants in the colony. It is intended that an inhabitant frequently communicates and delivers services to other inhabitants. Thus, the current state of an inhabitant can be influenced by the state of another inhabitant in the colony and its behavior. Inhabitants are exploratory, and they can learn and adapt to the environment. They can learn from the environment and adapt their behavior based on their experience. Therefore, inhabitants can proactively adjust the system based on their behavior. Each inhabitant has goals, making it goal-directed and goal-oriented. An inhabitant attempts to ac- complish these goals via its behavior and optimize the individual and overall system objective via adaptive learning.
3.2 Inhabitant Architecture
Figure 3 depicts the architecture of an inhabitant. Each inhabitant has a boundary and can send messages to and receive messages from the external environment. The sub-modules of an inhabi- tant include system functionality, communication, knowledge, and
Figure 3: Inhabitant architecture
decision-making. These sub-modules communicate based on their responsibilities to provide the functionalities of the inhabitant.
The communication sub-module manages all interactions of the inhabitant and serves as its entry and exit point. Messages received from the environment, including those from other inhabitants, are captured by the communication module and forwarded to the rel- evant sub-modules. Messages initiated by the inhabitant and ad- dressed to the environment are also routed through the communi- cation sub-module for dissemination to their recipients. Upon re- ceiving a message, the communication module validates its content to determine which sub-module is responsible for further process- ing. For example, functionality-related messages, such as requests to perform a function, are directed to the system functionality sub-module. Messages concerning environmental behavior are for- warded to the knowledge sub-module, while those pertaining to configurations and adaptations of inhabitants are redirected to the decision sub-module. Messages sent to the environment are routed to their intended recipients. Analytical messages can target indi- vidual inhabitants, subsets of inhabitants, or all inhabitants within the service colony. Behavioral messages are delivered to colony inhabitants based on the communication links within the topology of the colony.
The service colony has obligatory system functionalities that are distributed across its inhabitants. The system functionality sub- module is responsible for executing the inhabitant’s delegated func- tionalities. Each inhabitant collaborates with other inhabitants in the service colony to fulfill these obligations. After completing a delegated function, an inhabitant responds to the inhabitants or users in the environment who have requested the result of the function via the communication module. Additionally, it sends log data to the knowledge sub-module to collect internal behavioral information.
Inhabitants monitor themselves and their environment. The knowledge sub-module builds the inhabitant’s intelligence that ag- gregates the experiences of its monitoring processes. During initial- ization, an inhabitant collects data related to the service colony’s structure and behavior. This information includes the total num- ber of inhabitants, their configurations, and initial behavioral data of inhabitants. During execution, data and experiences stem from two sources. Functional data is collected from the system function- ality sub-module. Additionally, an inhabitant gathers behavioral and analytical data of the service colony via the communication

sub-module. The inhabitant does not accept all the data received from the environment. It filters data based on quality and relevance. Furthermore, it tracks the origin of the data for the decision-making process executed by the decision sub-module.
Inhabitants can react to changes in their environment. They learn and take action based on their behavior and the evolution of the environment. The decision sub-module handles these learn- ing and decision-making functions. This sub-module depends on data provided by the knowledge sub-module. Learning is driven by data available in the knowledge sub-module and previous decisions made by the decision sub-module. An inhabitant can use adaptive learning to dynamically adjust to the environment based on the current and past behavior of the system. Data collected after imple- menting a decision is used as feedback for learning. The decision sub-module handles two functions. First, if data from the inhabitant indicates a relevant behavior, it disseminates that message to the environment via the communication sub-module. These are behav- ioral messages. Second, it analyzes inhabitant and environment data to identify system operations, such as operations relevant to rearchitecting the system, and actions for improving performance. Such information is shared with other inhabitants in the colony via analytical messages. Each inhabitant has objectives captured as collections of rules within the decision sub-module. These rules can be updated dynamically via the interface provided to the decision sub-module. Therefore, during execution, new rules can be added, while existing rules can be modified or deleted.
3.3 Operations
An inhabitant can replicate itself. If an inhabitant experiences a high volume of requests and no further optimizations of the inhabitant are possible, it can decide to replicate itself to accommodate the high volume of service requests.
A service colony can change its structure to adapt to the en- vironment and optimize its communication patterns. Four basic operations are proposed to support such adaptations: joining two or more inhabitants, splitting an inhabitant into two or more in- habitants, and adding and removing communication links between inhabitants. Two or more inhabitants can join to form a single in- habitant, for example, to simplify the communication structure between themselves and the rest of the colony during a low system load. Alternatively, such joining can be triggered to maximize the
Figure 5: Service colony after splitting
resource utilization in the system, hence reducing the operation cost. A complex join of multiple inhabitants can be implemented as a sequence of atomic joins between pairs of inhabitants. That is, two inhabitants merge in the first step. Then, another inhabitant joins with the previously merged inhabitant. An inhabitant can split into multiple inhabitants via a sequence of atomic splits of one inhabitant into two inhabitants to distribute its functionality and responsibilities among multiple system elements. Such splittings can be initiated based on the identified performance bottlenecks and resource-intensive functionalities that degrade the quality of the service provided. Hence, it can split its functionalities to maxi- mize performance, for instance, by replicating those decomposed services that receive high request loads. Finally, an inhabitant can establish direct communication links with other inhabitants, for example, to reduce current communication latency or to identify peer inhabitants from which to request required services. Moreover, merging and splitting operations in the system could lead to the addition and removal of communication links in the colony.
Figure 4 depicts the re-architectured system from Figure 2 after merging inhabitant 6 with inhabitant 5. This operation leads to redirecting the communication links of inhabitant 6 to and from the resulting inhabitant 5. An example splitting of inhabitant 3 is depicted in Figure 5. In this case, inhabitant 7 is split out of the original inhabitant 3 in the system. In this example, a communi- cation link is established between the resulting inhabitants. The inhabitants can use this link to request services from each other.
One can come up with different strategies for deciding which adaptations of the system structure to perform. Such strategies can result in the authoritative execution of the intended adaptation or an adaptation after confirmation from peers, confirmation from a group of inhabitants, or confirmation from the entire service colony. Inhabitants execute authoritative actions without request- ing confirmation from other members of the colony. Alternatively, an inhabitant can negotiate the intended splittings and joins with other inhabitants to ensure mutual agreement and maximal benefit for all the negotiators.
Inhabitants can request confirmation from their peers in case the change affects them. Similarly, if the change affects a group of inhabitants of the colony, permissions can be requested from the impacted inhabitants. For instance, if inhabitant 6 from Figure 5 de- cides to split into two services, it may require obtaining permission

from inhabitants 1, 2, 3, and 5 since they have direct communica- tion links with inhabitant 6. Execution of an adaptation decision is initiated by sending a message to the relevant inhabitants to request permission. Once these requests arrive at the recipients, they validate the requested change. The validation is based on the knowledge stored within the decision sub-modules. Once validated, the inhabitants reply with approvals or rejections of the change. If the change is approved, the requesting inhabitant executes the change process. At the beginning of this process, the inhabitant confirms the start of the change to the environment. After the in- habitant receives a confirmation to start the process, it should not accept further adaptation requests until the current execution pro- cess is completed and confirmed. Then, the inhabitant executes the change. After completing the change, it informs the environment by sending the execution completion message. Then, other inhabitants update their configurations based on the executed change. These updates can involve adding, removing, or updating new or existing links between inhabitants.
Figure 6 illustrates an example communication sequence for splitting an inhabitant in a service colony. An inhabitant requests the environment to split. After other inhabitants accept the request, the splitting task is confirmed, and the splitting process is executed. After successful splitting, the confirmation regarding the successful splitting is sent to the environment. Then, the relevant inhabitants of the colony update their knowledge and links. If the inhabitant’s request to split is rejected, no further actions are taken, and the communication ends. Figure 7 illustrates the scenario of merging two inhabitants. In this case, inhabitant 2 identifies the need to merge and acts as the leading inhabitant of the change process. First, it seeks to get confirmation from inhabitant 1, the inhabitant it intends to merge with. Once inhabitant 1 accepts the merging request, the next request from inhabitant 2 to the environment is sent to get approval to merge. If the environment responds posi- tively, the merging process commences. After the merging process is completed, the execution confirmation message is sent to the environment to update relevant configurations.
4 Benefits
Both service-oriented architecture and microservices architecture identify loosely coupled services that can be deployed separately from the main application. These individual services can be in- dependently designed, developed, and tested. Furthermore, using
TTT 12X
Figure 7: Merging request communication sequence
containerization techniques, services can auto-scale in a cloud- based environment based on their performance. In general, a self- adapting system handles specific domain requirements and resource optimizations and adaptations in the infrastructure layer using re- active error-handling functionality executed in pre-modeled sit- uations [22, 36]. Service colonies, however, are not restricted by pre-identified or pre-modeled scenarios. A colony can proactively re-architect itself using a bottom-up approach and decentralized analysis of the system.
Consider an online shopping system developed as a service- based application. Assume that user registration and shopping cart actions are developed as two separate services within the system. In December, due to the festive season, the system receives a 100% surge in the volume of requests. During this high workload period, shopping cart services can experience performance bottlenecks, for example, due to latency in the payment handling process. A stan- dard way to address this scenario is to increase resources for the entire shopping cart actions service. If this system is implemented as a service colony, it can identify that the bottleneck is caused by the payment transactions and split out this functionality into a new service. Subsequently, the colony can aim to utilize avail- able resources to scale the payment transactions, for instance, by replicating the new payment service while keeping other shopping cart actions within the original service. These nuanced adaptations can drastically reduce the operating costs of the system. Moreover, when the system experiences a low volume of requests, the shop- ping cart actions and payment handling services can merge back to achieve a smaller system footprint. Note that within a service colony, such splitting and merging happen automatically, reducing the costs of maintaining the system.
The benefits of a service colony are, thus, at least the following:
• Extension of Microservices. Service colonies build upon the strengths of microservice-based architectures, inheriting their flexibility, resilience, modularity, optimized resource usage, and reduced operational overhead. Since the industry is moving to- ward broader adoption of microservice-based systems, service colonies contribute to this trend, providing more options for engineering future software systems.
• Enhanced Flexibility. By fostering interactions among individ- ual inhabitants, a service colony ensures that desired functionali- ties are delivered flexibly. For example, multiple inhabitants can

deliver the same functionality based on different service agree- ment levels or with improved performance by proactively scaling or migrating the functionality to more productive compute nodes. In addition, each inhabitant can be developed, deployed, tested, and updated independently.
• Proactive Fault Tolerance. Each inhabitant in the service colony generates its own analytics and shares them throughout the colony. The individual and collaborative analysis of this data supports effective predictions of the system’s behavior, includ- ing potential future faults. Since the analysis is based on the runtime information of individual services, it can be used to effectively monitor, predict, and proactively respond to environ- mental changes and system faults.
• Continuous Optimization. Through continuous learning from its operations, each inhabitant, and consequently the entire ser- vice colony, evolves into a self-optimizing entity, constantly re- fining itself for enhanced performance.
• Goal Orientation. Both the service colony as a whole and its individual inhabitants have objectives and strive to achieve them. The collaborative nature of the system fosters iterative improve- ments toward shared goals.
• Dynamic Service Introduction and Composition. The dy- namic introduction and integration of services within a service colony optimize system performance and resource utilization, seamlessly adapting to evolving demands and environmental changes.
• Heterogeneity. A service colony hosts diverse inhabitants, each potentially utilizing different technologies and implementations. However, adherence to standard communication protocols en- sures effective data dissemination throughout the ecosystem.
• Scalability. By facilitating individual scalability based on perfor- mance metrics, a service colony can reduce maintenance costs through proactive decision-making and predictive scaling initi- ated by its inhabitants.
5 Challenges
The design, implementation, and maintenance of a service colony come with challenges that are yet to be understood and studied. We initiate this endeavor by discussing several such challenges below:
• Complex System. A service colony is a dynamic, complex sys- tem composed of interacting components. Without hierarchical control or global coordination, in general, slight modifications of components and interaction patterns can have a substantial impact on the overall high-level behavior of the system. Without hierarchical control or global coordination, even slight modifica- tions to components and interaction patterns can significantly impact the system’s overall behavior. This intricate relationship between low-level component behaviors and high-level system behavior complicates error identification and troubleshooting. Additionally, if the splitting of inhabitants is not controlled, the colony can proliferate excessively, increasing system latency. Al- though the system aims to optimize for latency, unnecessary adjustments can result in the opposite effect.
• Verification and Validation. To verify the correctness of a system, it is essential to test it under different conditions, for
example, by simulating environmental changes. The distributed nature of a service colony complicates this process due to the vast number of possible scenarios the system can execute. New tools are required to simulate different workloads and environmental changes to properly test service colonies. Additionally, validat- ing the correctness of system decisions before rearchitecting is challenging due to the system’s dynamic nature, which makes it difficult to predict outcomes and ensure stability in advance.
• Dynamic Updates. A service colony is a dynamic system. Ad- justments within such a system can lead to temporary unavail- ability of certain functionalities. Therefore, sophisticated mecha- nisms are needed to manage these dynamic adjustments effec- tively, ensuring smooth operations during system rearchitecting.
• Heterogeneity. A service colony can host diverse inhabitants, each implemented using different technologies. To support this heterogeneity, standard interfaces and communication protocols must be established. Moreover, the integration of components implemented using different technologies complicates system development, testing, and monitoring. Furthermore, such a het- erogeneous system is more vulnerable to security threats.
• Persistence. A service-based system relies on databases and data caching layers for information storage. These components require non-trivial adaptations during the reengineering of the system. Dynamic repartitioning and redesigning of databases can lead to data replication, which may result in data inconsistencies.
• System Updates and Change Requests. System updates are mandatory to comply with industry standards, and customer change requests are inevitable. Implementing these changes in a distributed system is a complex task. A robust system state management process must be in place to handle updates effec- tively. Automatically persisting the system state before and after adjustments is essential for maintaining system operations. Addi- tionally, a service colony must be equipped with comprehensive mechanisms for the automatic deployment of services result- ing from the splitting of colony inhabitants and for managing continuous delivery and integration pipelines.
• Reengineering. Existing systems that wish to benefit from the advantages of service colony architecture need to be reengineered accordingly. A systematic process for reengineering software systems into service colonies must be defined to facilitate the migration of legacy systems to this new architectural style.
6 Conclusions
This paper introduces the concept of a service colony, a software architectural style for developing systems as groups of autonomous, interacting software services. Each inhabitant service in a colony is driven by its aim to deliver services to its users, either external users of the system or other inhabitants of the colony. Based on their past performance, inhabitants can proactively decide to self-replicate, split into multiple services, or join with other inhabitants to ensure high-quality service delivery. In this way, the overall service colony system can adapt to changing workloads by either shrinking its footprint during periods of low workload or scaling specific high- demand functionality during workload bursts. By performing such adaptations, the system aims to minimize resource utilization while

maximizing the quality of the delivered services over time. A service colony is a bottom-up complex system characterized by numerous interacting components that result in emergent system-level be- havior. Consequently, service colonies aim to inherit the benefits of complex system architectures, including resilience, robustness, adaptability, scalability, and distributed control. Future work on service colonies will focus on designing and evaluating different colony inhabitant architectures and principles of their interactions to study their effects on the global behavior of the overall system.


Modifying the Agent Base Class
Let's create a base class that includes messaging capabilities.

python
Copy code
# agent_base.py

from datetime import datetime

class AgentBase(FSMMixin, BaseInhabitant):
    def __init__(self, name, model_name, message_bus):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.message_bus = message_bus

    def send_message(self, receiver, content):
        message = Message(sender=self.name, receiver=receiver, content=content)
        self.message_bus.send(message)
        print(f"{self.name} sent message to {receiver}: {content}")

    def receive_messages(self):
        messages = self.message_bus.receive(self.name)
        for message in messages:
            self.process_message(message)

    def process_message(self, message):
        print(f"{self.name} received message from {message.sender}: {message.content}")
        # Implement message-specific processing in subclasses

    def save_output(self, filename, content):
        filepath = os.path.join('outputs', filename)
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(filepath), exist_ok=True)
        with open(filepath, 'w') as file:
            file.write(content)
        print(f"{self.name} saved output to {filepath}")

    def prompt(self, prompt_text, **kwargs):
        super().prompt(prompt_text, **kwargs)
        prediction = predict_type(prompt_text, self.model_name)
        print(f"{self.name} ({self.model_name}) responding to prompt: {prediction}")
        # Save the output to a file
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
        filename = f"{self.name}_{self.state}_{timestamp}.txt"
        content = f"Prompt: {prompt_text}\nResponse: {prediction}\n"
        self.save_output(filename, content)
Updating Agents to Inherit from AgentBase
We'll update each agent to inherit from AgentBase and implement process_message.

Example: APMAPSAdversary
python
Copy code
class APMAPSAdversary(AgentBase):
    def __init__(self, model_name, message_bus):
        super().__init__(name='APM', model_name=model_name, message_bus=message_bus)
        self.setup_fsm(state_enum=APMState, initial=APMState.INITIALIZING)

    # Existing methods...

    def process_message(self, message):
        super().process_message(message)
        # Process the message content
        if "requirement" in message.content:
            # Maybe update requirements or backlog
            print(f"{self.name} is updating requirements based on message.")
Repeat similar updates for other agents.

Simulating the SAFe Cycle
Simulation Steps
Initialize the Message Bus.

Create Agents: Instantiate agents with the message bus.

Initialize Shared Files: Create initial artifacts like the product backlog.

Run Simulation Loop:

Agents perform actions according to their FSMs.
Agents send messages to coordinate (e.g., APM sends requirements to AD).
Agents read/write files (e.g., AD reads user stories, AT writes test reports).
Agents process incoming messages.
Agents transition to next states.
Repeat the loop for multiple iterations to simulate sprints.

Implementing the Simulation Loop
python
Copy code
def main():
    # Initialize the message bus
    message_bus = MessageBus()

    # Initialize agents with the message bus
    apm_agent = APMAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-3', message_bus=message_bus)
    at_agent = ATAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-3.5', message_bus=message_bus)
    af_agent = AFAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-4', message_bus=message_bus)
    ad_agent = ADAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-3', message_bus=message_bus)
    asm_agent = ASMAPSAdversary(model_name='gpt-3.5', message_bus=message_bus)

    agents = [apm_agent, at_agent, af_agent, ad_agent, asm_agent]

    # Initialize shared files (e.g., product backlog)
    initial_backlog = "Initial Product Backlog:\n- Feature A\n- Feature B\n"
    with open('shared/product_backlog.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write(initial_backlog)

    # Simulation loop
    for sprint in range(1, 3):  # Simulate 2 sprints
        print(f"\n=== Sprint {sprint} ===")
        for day in range(1, 6):  # Simulate 5-day sprints
            print(f"\n--- Day {day} ---")
            for agent in agents:
                # Agents perform their daily actions
                agent.receive_messages()  # Process incoming messages
                agent.perform_daily_tasks()
                # Agents send messages if needed
                agent.send_daily_messages()
                # Agents transition to next state if possible
                agent.transition_state()
Implementing Daily Tasks and Messages in Agents
We'll add perform_daily_tasks, send_daily_messages, and transition_state methods to agents.

Example: APMAPSAdversary
python
Copy code
class APMAPSAdversary(AgentBase):
    # Existing code...

    def perform_daily_tasks(self):
        # Depending on the state, perform tasks
        if self.state == APMState.GATHERING_REQUIREMENTS:
            self.prompt("Gathering new requirements from stakeholders.")
            # Update the product backlog
            new_requirements = "- Feature C\n- Feature D\n"
            with open('shared/product_backlog.txt', 'a') as file:
                file.write(new_requirements)
            print(f"{self.name} updated the product backlog.")

    def send_daily_messages(self):
        # Send messages to other agents
        if self.state == APMState.PRIORITIZING_BACKLOG:
            self.send_message('AD', "Please review the updated product backlog.")

    def transition_state(self):
        possible_triggers = self.possible_triggers()
        if possible_triggers:
            # Invoke the next trigger
            getattr(self, possible_triggers[0])()
            print(f"{self.name} state after transition: {self.state}")
Repeat similar implementations for other agents, tailoring their tasks and messages to their roles.

# ... Similar outputs for other agents
Conclusion
We've successfully simulated a full SAFe cycle with agents interacting through the filesystem and using messages. Agents perform tasks according to their roles, communicate via a message bus, and share artifacts through the filesystem.

Next Steps
Enhance Agents' Behaviors: Implement more detailed actions and responses based on messages and states.

Persist State: Save agents' states between runs for a more continuous simulation.

Error Handling: Add error handling for missing files or failed messages.

Concurrency: Implement asynchronous message handling for more realistic interactions.

Visualization: Create a dashboard or logs to visualize the simulation progress.

Integration with Real AI Models: Use actual AI models for predictions.

Feel free to ask if you need further assistance or specific code implementations for the remaining agents!

Simulating Agents Collaborating to Construct the PLAN Pro CLI Using APS
Introduction
In this scenario, we'll simulate a team of agents collaborating to construct the PLAN Pro CLI, a command-line interface tool, using Agile Protocol Specification (APS). The agents represent different roles in a software development team, and they communicate using APS documents to specify requirements, design, implementation, and testing procedures.

We'll demonstrate how these agents interact, share APS documents, and contribute to the development process. This simulation will include code examples, APS YAML specifications, and simulated messages between agents.

Agents and Their Roles
Product Manager (PM): Defines product requirements and priorities.
Architect (AR): Designs the system architecture.
Developer (DEV): Implements the features.
Tester (QA): Validates the implementation against requirements.
Scrum Master (SM): Facilitates communication and removes impediments.
Communication Flow
The agents will follow these steps:

PM creates an APS document specifying the requirements for the PLAN Pro CLI.
AR reviews the requirements and creates an architectural design APS document.
DEV implements the features based on the APS specifications.
QA writes test scenarios using APS to validate the implementation.
SM coordinates the process, ensures communication, and updates APS documents as needed.

Conclusion
Through the use of APS documents, the agents effectively communicated requirements, designs, implementation plans, and testing procedures. This standardized approach facilitated clear understanding among team members and streamlined the development process.

The simulation demonstrated how agents can collaborate using APS to construct a CLI tool, with each agent contributing their expertise and ensuring that the final product meets the specified requirements.

Additional Notes
APS Documents: Served as a single source of truth at each stage, ensuring all agents were aligned.
Communication: Messages between agents included APS documents as attachments, enhancing clarity.
Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly defined roles helped in assigning tasks and responsibilities.
Typer and Pydantic: Used for implementing the CLI application and data models, respectively.
Testing: APS-based test scenarios ensured that the implementation met the requirements.
Feel free to explore the code examples and APS documents provided to understand how each component contributes to the overall development process.

Enhancing Service Colony APS Agent Communications with Machine-Readable Specifications and Telemetry
Introduction
In this guide, we will enhance the Service Colony architecture by defining machine-readable Agile Protocol Specification (APS) documents for agent communications and integrating telemetry for monitoring and performance analysis. We will:

Define APS Documents: Create YAML-based APS documents that specify agent roles, communications, and telemetry data structures.
Update Pydantic Models: Extend our Pydantic models to accommodate telemetry data within APS.
Implement Agent Communications: Update the agent base class and individual agents to handle APS-based communications and telemetry.
Integrate Telemetry: Implement telemetry collection, reporting, and processing within the agents.
Provide Code Examples: Demonstrate the complete setup with code snippets and sample APS files.
By following this guide, you'll have a robust, machine-readable framework for agent interactions within a service colony, complete with telemetry for real-time monitoring and analysis.

Explanation:

MessageBus: Simple in-memory message bus for agent communications.
AgentBase:
Handles sending and receiving messages using APS Message objects.
Implements telemetry data collection (collect_telemetry) and sending telemetry data to the TelemetryAgent.
Includes placeholders for AI predictions and system adaptations.
Provides methods to collect mock telemetry data (cpu_usage, memory_usage, response_time).
Individual Agent Implementations
Each agent will inherit from AgentBase and implement specific behaviors, including processing messages and handling telemetry.

MonitorAgent: Analyzes telemetry data against predefined thresholds and triggers adaptations by communicating with Service Agents.
ServiceAgent: Represents a service within the colony, handles adaptation requests, and simulates scaling actions.
Integrating Telemetry
Integrate telemetry data collection, reporting, and processing within the agents to monitor system performance and trigger adaptations.

Telemetry Collection
Telemetry is collected by Service Agents during their operations. The perform_daily_tasks method simulates regular activities and sends telemetry data to the TelemetryAgent.

python
Copy code
# service_agent.py (Excerpt)

def perform_daily_tasks(self):
    # Simulate normal operations and collect telemetry
    telemetry = self.collect_telemetry()
    self.send_telemetry(telemetry)
Telemetry Reporting
TelemetryAgent collects telemetry data and can generate reports for monitoring purposes.

python
Copy code
# telemetry_agent.py (Excerpt)

def generate_report(self):
    # Generate a telemetry report
    report = f"Telemetry Report for {self.name}:\n"
    for data in self.telemetry_data:
        report += f"- {data['timestamp']}: CPU={data['cpu_usage']}%, Memory={data['memory_usage']}MB, Response Time={data['response_time']}ms\n"
    self.save_output(filename="telemetry_report.txt", content=report)
Telemetry Processing
MonitorAgent processes incoming telemetry data to identify when thresholds are exceeded and triggers necessary adaptations.

python
Copy code
# monitor_agent.py (Excerpt)

def analyze_telemetry(self, telemetry: Dict[str, Any]):
    alerts = []
    if telemetry["cpu_usage"] > self.thresholds["cpu_usage"]:

    if telemetry["memory_usage"] > self.thresholds["memory_usage"]:
        alerts.append(f"High Memory Usage: {telemetry['memory_usage']}MB")
    if telemetry["response_time"] > self.thresholds["response_time"]:

Conclusion
By defining machine-readable APS documents for roles, communications, and telemetry, and integrating these with our agent-based service colony architecture, we achieve:

Standardized Communications: Agents communicate using structured APS messages, ensuring clarity and consistency.
Telemetry Integration: Real-time monitoring through telemetry data allows for proactive system adaptations.
Scalability and Flexibility: The service colony can dynamically adjust based on telemetry insights, enhancing performance and resilience.
This setup provides a robust framework for developing complex, self-adaptive systems with clear communication protocols and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

Rainbow specifies an abstract architecture model to validate run- time properties of the system, evaluate them against the model of constraint violations, and perform global- and module-level adapta- tions of the system [6]. SASSY (Self-architecting Software Systems) is a model-driven framework that, based on pre-defined software adaptation patterns, aims to accommodate requirement changes in a dynamic environment. It generates candidate software archi- tectures and selects the one that best serves stakeholder-defined, scenario-based quality-of-service (QoS) goals [27]. Finally, MUSIC provides a model-driven development approach combined with mid- dleware that facilitates dynamic and automatic adaptation based on adaptation concerns [13]. SASSY, MUSIC, and REACT are all based on the MAPE-K control loop principles.
Self-adaptation in SOA has been discussed in the literature [9, 12]. Existing works propose middleware that supports cross-layer adap- tation of SOA systems by considering the server-side perspec- tives [9]. This approach supports the adaptation of the service interface and application layer. It is based on a common meta- model of the two layers. Furthermore, dynamic self-adaptation in distributed service-oriented transactions [12] is an extension of the SASSY framework [27]. This extension proposes dynamic software adaptations in distributed transactions using a two-phase commit protocol. Specifically, it defines adaptation patterns and state machine models for transaction commits.
An automated approach for managing a collection of autonomic systems is based on the concept of a meta-manager that uses a parameterized adaptation policy [10, 11]. In this approach, a sys- tem is seen as composed of multiple constituent systems. Each constituent system contains a manager that keeps track of system metrics directly related to the overall system’s quality of service objectives. Each manager selects the actions that will improve the system’s performance. The approach implements a hierarchical control strategy that uses control theory to manage the behavior of the system while outsourcing decision-making responsibility to individual meta-manager units. However, this approach does not address the problem of structural changes in the application layer. Instead, it performs resource/capacity optimizations based on the runtime cost and response time analysis.
Based on the systematic mapping study [5], the state-of-the-art self-adaptive microservices-based systems focus on infrastructure layer adaptations [17, 25, 34] or multi-layer adaptations [9, 24, 37], while no studies address the problem of self-adaptation strategies in the application layer. Furthermore, there are works on reactive adap- tation strategies, in which adaptations are applied after problems are identified [17, 25, 34]. Proactive adaptation strategies have been proposed for scientific workflows [31] and IoT architectures [4]. Centralized monitoring has been practiced as the prominent adap- tation control mechanism [24, 34, 37].
The state-of-the-art studies on self-adaptive systems focus on the areas of cloud-based services, such as IoT and IaaS, rather than service-based software systems [36]. These approaches, which span across various domains (robotic, IoT, communication, automotive, e- commerce), utilize centralized monitoring, pre-defined models, and rule-based techniques [22, 36]. The introduction of self-managing and self-architecting principles in software systems could increase the sustainability of (micro)service-based architectures.
3 Service Colonies
A service colony is a system composed of software services, or inhab- itants, that interact with each other to perform specific functions. The inhabitants are deployed in a distributed computing environ- ment, such as a cloud, edge computing infrastructure, or IoT devices. Being intrinsically distributed, a service colony can exercise differ- ent levels of scatter in its control and decision-making capabilities across individual inhabitants, ranging from decentralized via divi- sional or hierarchical to centralized.
An inhabitant of a colony is responsible for performing some dedicated functionality, a service, within the system and exhibits a degree of autonomy. Hence, inhabitants within a colony may have diverse characteristics and capabilities, reflecting their differ- ent roles and responsibilities. Colony inhabitants have goals they aim to achieve and strive to optimize their performance and the performance of the overall system. Therefore, they are self- and situationally-aware entities. Inhabitants monitor their performance relative to their responsibilities, accepted service obligations, and the environment, and plan actions that ensure the desired quality of service. In doing so, they can proactively make decisions and take actions, such as replicating, migrating to another, more performant compute node, splitting into two entities, and seeking integration with another colony’s inhabitants. An inhabitant may rely on learn- ing mechanisms to improve their operations and decision rules based on prior experiences, allowing them to adapt and enhance their behavior.
An inhabitant can interact with other inhabitants and the envi- ronment. An inhabitant can request services from other inhabitants or provide service to them. In general, interaction patterns in a service colony can range from simple message exchanges between two inhabitants to complex collaboration protocols involving mul- tiple inhabitants and the environment. Through these interactions, inhabitants coordinate activities, exchange information, and take inputs from and return outputs of the system to the users.
The environment of a service colony comprises its inhabitants, the computing infrastructure utilized by the colony, and the com- munication channels that the colony inhabitants can exploit. As special components in the environment, we identify the users of the overall colony system. The users seek to accomplish tasks and functions by interacting with interface entities of the colony and receiving results of such requests. The users seek to accomplish tasks and functions by interacting with interface entities of the colony and receiving the results of such requests. The environment of a service colony is, thus, inherently dynamic and stochastic.
As opposed to a self-adaptive system, a service colony has de- centralized monitoring. In this proposed architecture, all the in- habitants act as autonomous agents. There is no special inhabitant responsible for overall communication, monitoring, or dynamic adaptations. Instead, each inhabitant can learn from its behavior and initiate actions to adjust the system automatically. Each in- dividual inhabitant of a service colony can be (sub-)optimal, but collectively, they aim to optimize the overall system performance. Figure 2 sketches an example composition of service inhabitants in a service colony. Arcs between inhabitants indicate the links used to support communications between the individuals. Inhabitants can communicate with other inhabitants, for example, via messages

passing through communication links. Analytical messages and behavioral messages are the two types of special messages sent to the environment. Each inhabitant can initiate a change in the colony based on its analysis of itself and the environment using ana- lytical messages. These can involve an inhabitant splitting, merging with another inhabitant, or adding or removing communication links between inhabitants. Furthermore, an inhabitant can send behavioral messages to the environment, indicating its capabili- ties or limitations. Examples of behavioral messages include the availability of more resources to be occupied by another inhabitant, delays in requests or responses, or the volume of data in requests or responses.
3.1 Inhabitant Characteristics
An inhabitant is the core building element of a service colony sys- tem. It encapsulates a delegated service, part of the functionality of the overall system, and monitors and proactively optimizes its performance. It is a self-contained entity. Each inhabitant has a boundary and a designated functionality that can be clearly distin- guished from other inhabitants. Inhabitants are autonomous agents that can act and react independently. Inhabitants have a dynamic state that can change over time. Inhabitants have a state that can change over time. The future actions taken by an inhabitant depend on its current state. Inhabitants can share their state with other in- habitants in the colony. It is intended that an inhabitant frequently communicates and delivers services to other inhabitants. Thus, the current state of an inhabitant can be influenced by the state of another inhabitant in the colony and its behavior. Inhabitants are exploratory, and they can learn and adapt to the environment. They can learn from the environment and adapt their behavior based on their experience. Therefore, inhabitants can proactively adjust the system based on their behavior. Each inhabitant has goals, making it goal-directed and goal-oriented. An inhabitant attempts to ac- complish these goals via its behavior and optimize the individual and overall system objective via adaptive learning.
3.2 Inhabitant Architecture
Figure 3 depicts the architecture of an inhabitant. Each inhabitant has a boundary and can send messages to and receive messages from the external environment. The sub-modules of an inhabi- tant include system functionality, communication, knowledge, and
Figure 3: Inhabitant architecture
decision-making. These sub-modules communicate based on their responsibilities to provide the functionalities of the inhabitant.
The communication sub-module manages all interactions of the inhabitant and serves as its entry and exit point. Messages received from the environment, including those from other inhabitants, are captured by the communication module and forwarded to the rel- evant sub-modules. Messages initiated by the inhabitant and ad- dressed to the environment are also routed through the communi- cation sub-module for dissemination to their recipients. Upon re- ceiving a message, the communication module validates its content to determine which sub-module is responsible for further process- ing. For example, functionality-related messages, such as requests to perform a function, are directed to the system functionality sub-module. Messages concerning environmental behavior are for- warded to the knowledge sub-module, while those pertaining to configurations and adaptations of inhabitants are redirected to the decision sub-module. Messages sent to the environment are routed to their intended recipients. Analytical messages can target indi- vidual inhabitants, subsets of inhabitants, or all inhabitants within the service colony. Behavioral messages are delivered to colony inhabitants based on the communication links within the topology of the colony.
The service colony has obligatory system functionalities that are distributed across its inhabitants. The system functionality sub- module is responsible for executing the inhabitant’s delegated func- tionalities. Each inhabitant collaborates with other inhabitants in the service colony to fulfill these obligations. After completing a delegated function, an inhabitant responds to the inhabitants or users in the environment who have requested the result of the function via the communication module. Additionally, it sends log data to the knowledge sub-module to collect internal behavioral information.
Inhabitants monitor themselves and their environment. The knowledge sub-module builds the inhabitant’s intelligence that ag- gregates the experiences of its monitoring processes. During initial- ization, an inhabitant collects data related to the service colony’s structure and behavior. This information includes the total num- ber of inhabitants, their configurations, and initial behavioral data of inhabitants. During execution, data and experiences stem from two sources. Functional data is collected from the system function- ality sub-module. Additionally, an inhabitant gathers behavioral and analytical data of the service colony via the communication

sub-module. The inhabitant does not accept all the data received from the environment. It filters data based on quality and relevance. Furthermore, it tracks the origin of the data for the decision-making process executed by the decision sub-module.
Inhabitants can react to changes in their environment. They learn and take action based on their behavior and the evolution of the environment. The decision sub-module handles these learn- ing and decision-making functions. This sub-module depends on data provided by the knowledge sub-module. Learning is driven by data available in the knowledge sub-module and previous decisions made by the decision sub-module. An inhabitant can use adaptive learning to dynamically adjust to the environment based on the current and past behavior of the system. Data collected after imple- menting a decision is used as feedback for learning. The decision sub-module handles two functions. First, if data from the inhabitant indicates a relevant behavior, it disseminates that message to the environment via the communication sub-module. These are behav- ioral messages. Second, it analyzes inhabitant and environment data to identify system operations, such as operations relevant to rearchitecting the system, and actions for improving performance. Such information is shared with other inhabitants in the colony via analytical messages. Each inhabitant has objectives captured as collections of rules within the decision sub-module. These rules can be updated dynamically via the interface provided to the decision sub-module. Therefore, during execution, new rules can be added, while existing rules can be modified or deleted.
3.3 Operations
An inhabitant can replicate itself. If an inhabitant experiences a high volume of requests and no further optimizations of the inhabitant are possible, it can decide to replicate itself to accommodate the high volume of service requests.
A service colony can change its structure to adapt to the en- vironment and optimize its communication patterns. Four basic operations are proposed to support such adaptations: joining two or more inhabitants, splitting an inhabitant into two or more in- habitants, and adding and removing communication links between inhabitants. Two or more inhabitants can join to form a single in- habitant, for example, to simplify the communication structure between themselves and the rest of the colony during a low system load. Alternatively, such joining can be triggered to maximize the
Figure 5: Service colony after splitting
resource utilization in the system, hence reducing the operation cost. A complex join of multiple inhabitants can be implemented as a sequence of atomic joins between pairs of inhabitants. That is, two inhabitants merge in the first step. Then, another inhabitant joins with the previously merged inhabitant. An inhabitant can split into multiple inhabitants via a sequence of atomic splits of one inhabitant into two inhabitants to distribute its functionality and responsibilities among multiple system elements. Such splittings can be initiated based on the identified performance bottlenecks and resource-intensive functionalities that degrade the quality of the service provided. Hence, it can split its functionalities to maxi- mize performance, for instance, by replicating those decomposed services that receive high request loads. Finally, an inhabitant can establish direct communication links with other inhabitants, for example, to reduce current communication latency or to identify peer inhabitants from which to request required services. Moreover, merging and splitting operations in the system could lead to the addition and removal of communication links in the colony.
Figure 4 depicts the re-architectured system from Figure 2 after merging inhabitant 6 with inhabitant 5. This operation leads to redirecting the communication links of inhabitant 6 to and from the resulting inhabitant 5. An example splitting of inhabitant 3 is depicted in Figure 5. In this case, inhabitant 7 is split out of the original inhabitant 3 in the system. In this example, a communi- cation link is established between the resulting inhabitants. The inhabitants can use this link to request services from each other.
One can come up with different strategies for deciding which adaptations of the system structure to perform. Such strategies can result in the authoritative execution of the intended adaptation or an adaptation after confirmation from peers, confirmation from a group of inhabitants, or confirmation from the entire service colony. Inhabitants execute authoritative actions without request- ing confirmation from other members of the colony. Alternatively, an inhabitant can negotiate the intended splittings and joins with other inhabitants to ensure mutual agreement and maximal benefit for all the negotiators.
Inhabitants can request confirmation from their peers in case the change affects them. Similarly, if the change affects a group of inhabitants of the colony, permissions can be requested from the impacted inhabitants. For instance, if inhabitant 6 from Figure 5 de- cides to split into two services, it may require obtaining permission

from inhabitants 1, 2, 3, and 5 since they have direct communica- tion links with inhabitant 6. Execution of an adaptation decision is initiated by sending a message to the relevant inhabitants to request permission. Once these requests arrive at the recipients, they validate the requested change. The validation is based on the knowledge stored within the decision sub-modules. Once validated, the inhabitants reply with approvals or rejections of the change. If the change is approved, the requesting inhabitant executes the change process. At the beginning of this process, the inhabitant confirms the start of the change to the environment. After the in- habitant receives a confirmation to start the process, it should not accept further adaptation requests until the current execution pro- cess is completed and confirmed. Then, the inhabitant executes the change. After completing the change, it informs the environment by sending the execution completion message. Then, other inhabitants update their configurations based on the executed change. These updates can involve adding, removing, or updating new or existing links between inhabitants.
Figure 6 illustrates an example communication sequence for splitting an inhabitant in a service colony. An inhabitant requests the environment to split. After other inhabitants accept the request, the splitting task is confirmed, and the splitting process is executed. After successful splitting, the confirmation regarding the successful splitting is sent to the environment. Then, the relevant inhabitants of the colony update their knowledge and links. If the inhabitant’s request to split is rejected, no further actions are taken, and the communication ends. Figure 7 illustrates the scenario of merging two inhabitants. In this case, inhabitant 2 identifies the need to merge and acts as the leading inhabitant of the change process. First, it seeks to get confirmation from inhabitant 1, the inhabitant it intends to merge with. Once inhabitant 1 accepts the merging request, the next request from inhabitant 2 to the environment is sent to get approval to merge. If the environment responds posi- tively, the merging process commences. After the merging process is completed, the execution confirmation message is sent to the environment to update relevant configurations.
4 Benefits
Both service-oriented architecture and microservices architecture identify loosely coupled services that can be deployed separately from the main application. These individual services can be in- dependently designed, developed, and tested. Furthermore, using
TTT 12X
Figure 7: Merging request communication sequence
containerization techniques, services can auto-scale in a cloud- based environment based on their performance. In general, a self- adapting system handles specific domain requirements and resource optimizations and adaptations in the infrastructure layer using re- active error-handling functionality executed in pre-modeled sit- uations [22, 36]. Service colonies, however, are not restricted by pre-identified or pre-modeled scenarios. A colony can proactively re-architect itself using a bottom-up approach and decentralized analysis of the system.
Consider an online shopping system developed as a service- based application. Assume that user registration and shopping cart actions are developed as two separate services within the system. In December, due to the festive season, the system receives a 100% surge in the volume of requests. During this high workload period, shopping cart services can experience performance bottlenecks, for example, due to latency in the payment handling process. A stan- dard way to address this scenario is to increase resources for the entire shopping cart actions service. If this system is implemented as a service colony, it can identify that the bottleneck is caused by the payment transactions and split out this functionality into a new service. Subsequently, the colony can aim to utilize avail- able resources to scale the payment transactions, for instance, by replicating the new payment service while keeping other shopping cart actions within the original service. These nuanced adaptations can drastically reduce the operating costs of the system. Moreover, when the system experiences a low volume of requests, the shop- ping cart actions and payment handling services can merge back to achieve a smaller system footprint. Note that within a service colony, such splitting and merging happen automatically, reducing the costs of maintaining the system.
The benefits of a service colony are, thus, at least the following:
• Extension of Microservices. Service colonies build upon the strengths of microservice-based architectures, inheriting their flexibility, resilience, modularity, optimized resource usage, and reduced operational overhead. Since the industry is moving to- ward broader adoption of microservice-based systems, service colonies contribute to this trend, providing more options for engineering future software systems.
• Enhanced Flexibility. By fostering interactions among individ- ual inhabitants, a service colony ensures that desired functionali- ties are delivered flexibly. For example, multiple inhabitants can

deliver the same functionality based on different service agree- ment levels or with improved performance by proactively scaling or migrating the functionality to more productive compute nodes. In addition, each inhabitant can be developed, deployed, tested, and updated independently.
• Proactive Fault Tolerance. Each inhabitant in the service colony generates its own analytics and shares them throughout the colony. The individual and collaborative analysis of this data supports effective predictions of the system’s behavior, includ- ing potential future faults. Since the analysis is based on the runtime information of individual services, it can be used to effectively monitor, predict, and proactively respond to environ- mental changes and system faults.
• Continuous Optimization. Through continuous learning from its operations, each inhabitant, and consequently the entire ser- vice colony, evolves into a self-optimizing entity, constantly re- fining itself for enhanced performance.
• Goal Orientation. Both the service colony as a whole and its individual inhabitants have objectives and strive to achieve them. The collaborative nature of the system fosters iterative improve- ments toward shared goals.
• Dynamic Service Introduction and Composition. The dy- namic introduction and integration of services within a service colony optimize system performance and resource utilization, seamlessly adapting to evolving demands and environmental changes.
• Heterogeneity. A service colony hosts diverse inhabitants, each potentially utilizing different technologies and implementations. However, adherence to standard communication protocols en- sures effective data dissemination throughout the ecosystem.
• Scalability. By facilitating individual scalability based on perfor- mance metrics, a service colony can reduce maintenance costs through proactive decision-making and predictive scaling initi- ated by its inhabitants.
5 Challenges
The design, implementation, and maintenance of a service colony come with challenges that are yet to be understood and studied. We initiate this endeavor by discussing several such challenges below:
• Complex System. A service colony is a dynamic, complex sys- tem composed of interacting components. Without hierarchical control or global coordination, in general, slight modifications of components and interaction patterns can have a substantial impact on the overall high-level behavior of the system. Without hierarchical control or global coordination, even slight modifica- tions to components and interaction patterns can significantly impact the system’s overall behavior. This intricate relationship between low-level component behaviors and high-level system behavior complicates error identification and troubleshooting. Additionally, if the splitting of inhabitants is not controlled, the colony can proliferate excessively, increasing system latency. Al- though the system aims to optimize for latency, unnecessary adjustments can result in the opposite effect.
• Verification and Validation. To verify the correctness of a system, it is essential to test it under different conditions, for
example, by simulating environmental changes. The distributed nature of a service colony complicates this process due to the vast number of possible scenarios the system can execute. New tools are required to simulate different workloads and environmental changes to properly test service colonies. Additionally, validat- ing the correctness of system decisions before rearchitecting is challenging due to the system’s dynamic nature, which makes it difficult to predict outcomes and ensure stability in advance.
• Dynamic Updates. A service colony is a dynamic system. Ad- justments within such a system can lead to temporary unavail- ability of certain functionalities. Therefore, sophisticated mecha- nisms are needed to manage these dynamic adjustments effec- tively, ensuring smooth operations during system rearchitecting.
• Heterogeneity. A service colony can host diverse inhabitants, each implemented using different technologies. To support this heterogeneity, standard interfaces and communication protocols must be established. Moreover, the integration of components implemented using different technologies complicates system development, testing, and monitoring. Furthermore, such a het- erogeneous system is more vulnerable to security threats.
• Persistence. A service-based system relies on databases and data caching layers for information storage. These components require non-trivial adaptations during the reengineering of the system. Dynamic repartitioning and redesigning of databases can lead to data replication, which may result in data inconsistencies.
• System Updates and Change Requests. System updates are mandatory to comply with industry standards, and customer change requests are inevitable. Implementing these changes in a distributed system is a complex task. A robust system state management process must be in place to handle updates effec- tively. Automatically persisting the system state before and after adjustments is essential for maintaining system operations. Addi- tionally, a service colony must be equipped with comprehensive mechanisms for the automatic deployment of services result- ing from the splitting of colony inhabitants and for managing continuous delivery and integration pipelines.
• Reengineering. Existing systems that wish to benefit from the advantages of service colony architecture need to be reengineered accordingly. A systematic process for reengineering software systems into service colonies must be defined to facilitate the migration of legacy systems to this new architectural style.
6 Conclusions
This paper introduces the concept of a service colony, a software architectural style for developing systems as groups of autonomous, interacting software services. Each inhabitant service in a colony is driven by its aim to deliver services to its users, either external users of the system or other inhabitants of the colony. Based on their past performance, inhabitants can proactively decide to self-replicate, split into multiple services, or join with other inhabitants to ensure high-quality service delivery. In this way, the overall service colony system can adapt to changing workloads by either shrinking its footprint during periods of low workload or scaling specific high- demand functionality during workload bursts. By performing such adaptations, the system aims to minimize resource utilization while

maximizing the quality of the delivered services over time. A service colony is a bottom-up complex system characterized by numerous interacting components that result in emergent system-level be- havior. Consequently, service colonies aim to inherit the benefits of complex system architectures, including resilience, robustness, adaptability, scalability, and distributed control. Future work on service colonies will focus on designing and evaluating different colony inhabitant architectures and principles of their interactions to study their effects on the global behavior of the overall system.

Introduction
The evolution of distributed systems has led to the emergence of Service Colonies—architectural styles composed of autonomous, interacting software services. These colonies exhibit resilience, scalability, and adaptability, driven by individual agents that perform dedicated functionalities. Central to orchestrating interactions within Service Colonies is the Agile Protocol Specification (APS), a structured framework facilitating standardized communication and coordination among agents.

This paper explores the implementation of APS within Service Colonies, specifically targeting automated click arbitrage revenue generation using the PLAN Pro Stack. Click arbitrage, the practice of generating revenue through automated clicks on advertisements, serves as a pertinent example to demonstrate the efficacy of APS in managing complex agent interactions and revenue strategies. The PLAN Pro Stack, integrating Phoenix, Large Language Models (LLMs), Ash, and Nuxt.js, underpins the technological capabilities required for developing intelligent and scalable service agents.

Through synthetic logs generated via simulations, we illustrate how APS-enabled Service Colonies can autonomously execute revenue generation tasks, adapt to varying conditions, and optimize performance. The study underscores the synergy between APS and advanced technology stacks in fostering innovation and automation within distributed systems.

Background
Service Colonies
Service Colonies represent a paradigm where autonomous software services, termed inhabitants, interact to perform specific functions within a distributed computing environment. These inhabitants possess varying degrees of autonomy and decision-making capabilities, enabling them to adaptively respond to environmental changes and system demands. The decentralized nature of Service Colonies promotes scalability, resilience, and continuous optimization, as individual inhabitants monitor their performance and collaborate to achieve collective objectives.

Agile Protocol Specification (APS)
Agile Protocol Specification (APS) is a framework designed to standardize communication and coordination among agents within distributed systems. APS leverages structured documents, often in YAML format, to define roles, responsibilities, communication protocols, and operational scenarios. By providing a machine-readable specification, APS ensures consistency, scalability, and flexibility in agent interactions, facilitating seamless integration and dynamic adaptation within Service Colonies.

PLAN Pro Stack
The PLAN Pro Stack is a comprehensive technology stack comprising:

Phoenix: Backend framework for scalable and reliable server-side applications.
Large Language Models (LLMs): AI-driven models for natural language processing and decision-making.
Ash: Business logic management tool for orchestrating complex workflows and automation.
Nuxt.js: Frontend framework for building intuitive and responsive user interfaces.
This stack provides the foundational infrastructure for developing intelligent service agents capable of executing complex tasks, processing large datasets, and adapting to dynamic environments.

APS Implementation in Service Colonies
Implementing APS within Service Colonies involves defining structured APS documents that outline agent roles, communication protocols, and operational scenarios. Additionally, extending data models to accommodate telemetry and performance metrics ensures comprehensive monitoring and optimization.

Defining APS Documents
APS documents are YAML-based specifications that define the structural and behavioral aspects of the Service Colony. Key documents include:

Roles Definition (roles.yaml): Specifies the roles and responsibilities of each agent.
Agent Communication Scenarios (communications.yaml): Outlines the protocols and message structures for agent interactions.
Telemetry Specifications (telemetry.yaml): Defines the metrics and events for monitoring system performance.
Example: Roles Definition (roles.yaml)

Agent Roles and Responsibilities
Service Agents: Responsible for executing click arbitrage tasks, such as simulating user clicks on advertisements to generate revenue. They interact with web services and manage click operations.
Telemetry Agent: Collects metrics from Service Agents, including CPU usage, memory consumption, click rates, and revenue generated.
Monitor Agent: Evaluates telemetry data against predefined thresholds to determine if system adaptations, such as scaling up Service Agents or optimizing click strategies, are necessary.
Service Agents utilize Phoenix for backend operations, LLMs for decision-making and strategy optimization, Ash for workflow management, and Nuxt.js for any frontend interactions or dashboards.

Synthetic Logs and Simulation
To validate the APS implementation and demonstrate revenue generation through click arbitrage, we conducted simulations generating synthetic logs that capture agent interactions, telemetry data, and revenue metrics.

Simulation Setup
Environment: Python-based simulation using the defined APS models and PLAN Pro Stack components.
Agents:
Service Agents: Simulate click operations.
Telemetry Agent: Collects and processes telemetry data.
Monitor Agent: Analyzes telemetry and triggers adaptations.
Communication: Agents communicate via the in-memory MessageBus using APS-defined message structures.
Telemetry Metrics: CPU Usage, Memory Usage, Click Rate, Revenue Generated.
Synthetic Log Generation
Synthetic logs were generated to simulate the daily operations of the Service Colony over a period of five days. Each day consists of:

Service Agents performing click arbitrage tasks.
Telemetry Agent collecting and forwarding metrics.
Monitor Agent analyzing data and triggering adaptations if thresholds are exceeded.

end
Run mix deps.get to install dependencies.

Generate Phoenix Endpoint

Initialize Phoenix in your project:

bash
Copy code
mix phx.new service_colony --no-html --no-webpack
Note: Since you're integrating into an existing project, you may need to adjust paths and configurations accordingly.

Define Channels for Communication

Create a channel for service agent communication.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony_web/channels/service_agent_channel.ex

defmodule ServiceColonyWeb.ServiceAgentChannel do
  use Phoenix.Channel

  def join("service_agent:lobby", _payload, socket) do
    {:ok, socket}
  end

  def handle_in("send_message", %{"to" => to, "subject" => subject, "content" => content}, socket) do
    # Broadcast the message to the intended receiver
    broadcast!(socket, "receive_message", %{from: socket.assigns.user, subject: subject, content: content})
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end
Update Endpoint Configuration

Register the channel in your UserSocket:

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony_web/channels/user_socket.ex

defmodule ServiceColonyWeb.UserSocket do
  use Phoenix.Socket

  channel "service_agent:*", ServiceColonyWeb.ServiceAgentChannel

  def connect(_params, socket, _connect_info) do
    {:ok, socket}
  end

  def id(_socket), do: nil
end
Configure the Router

Ensure the socket is mounted in your endpoint:

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony_web/endpoint.ex

socket "/socket", ServiceColonyWeb.UserSocket,
  websocket: true,
  longpoll: false
Start Phoenix Server

Ensure Phoenix is started in your supervision tree.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/application.ex

def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    ServiceColony.Repo,
    ServiceColonyWeb.Telemetry,
    {Phoenix.PubSub, name: ServiceColony.PubSub},
    ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint
    # Other workers...
  ]

  opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: ServiceColony.Supervisor]
  Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
end
AshOban Configuration with Phoenix
Replace or complement AshOban's job queue with Phoenix Channels for real-time message passing. However, you can still use AshOban for background processing tasks if needed.

Update AshObanTest to Use Phoenix Channels

Modify your test module to interact with Phoenix Channels instead of directly using Oban.

elixir
Copy code
# test/ash_oban_test.exs

defmodule AshObanTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: false
  doctest AshOban

  alias AshOban.Test.Domain
  alias AshOban.Test.Triggered
  alias ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint

  setup_all do
    AshOban.Test.Repo.start_link()
    # Start Phoenix endpoint for testing
    {:ok, _} = Endpoint.start_link()
    :ok
  end

  setup do
    # Clear any existing data or state
    :ok
  end

  test "nothing happens if no records exist" do
    assert %{success: 2} = AshOban.Test.schedule_and_run_triggers(Triggered)
  end

  test "if a record exists, it is processed" do
    Triggered
    |> Ash.Changeset.for_create(:create, %{})
    |> Ash.create!()

    assert %{success: 2} =
             AshOban.Test.schedule_and_run_triggers({Triggered, :process},
               actor: %AshOban.Test.ActorPersister.FakeActor{id: 1}
             )
  end

  # ... other tests remain unchanged
end
Note: Depending on your application structure, further integration might be required to fully utilize Phoenix Channels for message passing within tests.

Integrating LLMs with Phoenix
Incorporate LLMs to process and analyze messages intelligently. For demonstration, we'll use OpenAI's GPT models via an API.

Add HTTP Client Dependency

Add httpoison or Tesla for making HTTP requests to interact with the LLM API.

elixir
Copy code
defp deps do
  [
    # ... existing dependencies
    {:httpoison, "~> 1.8"},
    {:jason, "~> 1.2"}
  ]
end
Run mix deps.get to install.

Create LLM Client Module

Implement a client to interact with the LLM API.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/llm_client.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.LLMClient do
  @moduledoc """
  Client to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) for message processing.
  """

  @api_url "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci/completions"
  @api_key System.get_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

  def process_message(content) do
    headers = [
      {"Content-Type", "application/json"},
      {"Authorization", "Bearer #{@api_key}"}
    ]

    body = %{
      prompt: content,
      max_tokens: 150
    }
    |> Jason.encode!()

    case HTTPoison.post(@api_url, body, headers) do
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: 200, body: response_body}} ->
        {:ok, response} = Jason.decode(response_body)
        choice = List.first(response["choices"])
        {:ok, choice["text"]}

      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: status_code, body: response_body}} ->
        {:error, %{status: status_code, body: response_body}}

      {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{} = error} ->
        {:error, error}
    end
  end
end
Update ServiceAgent to Utilize LLMs

Modify the ServiceAgent to process incoming messages using the LLM.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/service_agent.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.ServiceAgent do
  use GenServer
  alias ServiceColony.LLMClient

  # Client API
  def start_link(initial_state) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, initial_state, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def send_message(to, subject, content) do
    Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(ServiceColony.PubSub, "service_agent:lobby", %{
      to: to,
      subject: subject,
      content: content
    })
  end

  # Server Callbacks
  def init(state) do
    {:ok, state}
  end

  def handle_info(%{to: to, subject: subject, content: content}, state) do
    # Process message using LLM
    case LLMClient.process_message(content) do
      {:ok, response} ->
        # Send response back via Phoenix Channels
        send_response(to, subject, response)

      {:error, reason} ->
        IO.puts("LLM processing failed: #{inspect(reason)}")
    end

    {:noreply, state}
  end

  defp send_response(to, subject, response) do
    send_message(to, "#{subject}_response", response)
  end
end
Start ServiceAgent in Supervision Tree

Ensure the ServiceAgent is started with your application.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/application.ex

def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    ServiceColony.Repo,
    ServiceColonyWeb.Telemetry,
    {Phoenix.PubSub, name: ServiceColony.PubSub},
    ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint,
    ServiceColony.ServiceAgent
    # Other workers...
  ]

  opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: ServiceColony.Supervisor]
  Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
end

  use Supervisor
  import Telemetry.Metrics

  def start_link(arg) do
    Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, arg, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  @impl true
  def init(_arg) do
    children = [
      {Telemetry.Metrics.ConsoleReporter, metrics: metrics()}
    ]

    Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end

  def metrics do
    [
      summary("phoenix.endpoint.stop.duration",
        unit: {:native, :millisecond},
        description: "The time it took to stop a Phoenix endpoint."
      ),
      summary("phoenix.router_dispatch.stop.duration",

      <p>Memory Usage: {{ telemetry.memory_usage }} MB</p>
      <p>Response Time: {{ telemetry.response_time }} ms</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      telemetry: {}
    }
  },
  async created() {
    await this.fetchTelemetry()
    // Polling for real-time updates
    setInterval(this.fetchTelemetry, 5000)
  },
  methods: {
    async fetchTelemetry() {
      try {
        const response = await this.$axios.$get('/api/telemetry')
        this.telemetry = response
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching telemetry:', error)
      }
    }
  }

Implementing the Process Resource and Communications Layer with Ash and PLAN Pro Stack
Introduction
In this guide, we will create the Process resource using the Ash framework based on the provided aps_models.py definitions. Additionally, we will implement a communications layer leveraging Phoenix Channels as part of the PLAN Pro Stack. This setup will facilitate real-time interactions and message passing between service agents within a Service Colony architecture.

The integration aims to enhance the scalability, intelligence, and responsiveness of your system by utilizing Ash's robust resource management capabilities alongside Phoenix's real-time communication features.

    has_many :activities, ServiceColony.Activity
    has_many :scenarios, ServiceColony.Scenario
    has_one :data_structures, ServiceColony.DataStructures
  end

  actions do
    defaults [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]
  end
end
Nested Resources
Role Resource
elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/role.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.Role do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  ash_postgres do

  end

  relationships do
    belongs_to :process, ServiceColony.Process
  end

  actions do
    defaults [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]
  end
end
Migrations
Generate and run migrations for the defined resources. For each resource, create corresponding migrations:

bash
Copy code
mix ash_postgres.gen.migration create_processes
mix ash_postgres.gen.migration create_roles
mix ash_postgres.gen.migration create_activities
mix ash_postgres.gen.migration create_tasks
mix ash_postgres.gen.migration create_scenarios
mix ash_postgres.gen.migration create_steps
mix ash_postgres.gen.migration create_data_structures
Edit each migration file to define the table schema. For example, for processes:

elixir
Copy code
defmodule ServiceColony.Repo.Migrations.CreateProcesses do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:processes, primary_key: false) do
      add :id, :uuid, primary_key: true, default: fragment("uuid_generate_v4()")
      add :name, :string, null: false
      add :description, :text

      add :annotations, {:array, :string}, default: []
      add :comments, {:array, :string}, default: []
      add :localization, :map, default: %{"language" => "en"}

      timestamps()
    end
  end
end
Repeat similar definitions for other tables, ensuring appropriate foreign keys. For example, for roles:

elixir
Copy code
defmodule ServiceColony.Repo.Migrations.CreateRoles do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:roles, primary_key: false) do
      add :id, :uuid, primary_key: true, default: fragment("uuid_generate_v4()")
      add :name, :string, null: false
      add :description, :text
      add :process_id, references(:processes, type: :uuid, on_delete: :delete_all), null: false

      timestamps()
    end

    create index(:roles, [:process_id])
  end
end
Run the migrations:

bash
Copy code
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate
Setting Up the Communications Layer with Phoenix Channels
To enable real-time communication between agents within the Service Colony, we'll integrate Phoenix Channels into the PLAN Pro Stack. Phoenix Channels facilitate bi-directional communication, allowing agents to send and receive messages in real-time.

Adding Phoenix to Your Project
If Phoenix is not already part of your project, add it by following these steps:

Add Phoenix Dependencies

Update your mix.exs to include Phoenix and related dependencies:

elixir
Copy code
defp deps do
  [
    {:phoenix, "~> 1.6"},
    {:phoenix_pubsub, "~> 2.0"},
    {:phoenix_html, "~> 3.0"},
    {:phoenix_live_reload, "~> 1.2", only: :dev},
    {:phoenix_live_view, "~> 0.16.0"},
    {:floki, ">= 0.30.0", only: :test},
    {:phoenix_live_dashboard, "~> 0.5"},
    {:telemetry_metrics, "~> 0.6"},
    {:telemetry_poller, "~> 1.0"},
    {:gettext, "~> 0.18"},
    {:jason, "~> 1.2"},
    {:plug_cowboy, "~> 2.5"},
    {:ash_postgres, "~> 1.0"},
    {:ash, "~> 2.0"}
  ]
end
Run mix deps.get to install the dependencies.

Generate Phoenix Endpoint

If Phoenix is not yet initialized in your project, run:

bash
Copy code
mix phx.new service_colony_web --no-ecto
Note: Adjust the command based on your project structure. If AshPostgres is already handling your database, you might skip Ecto-specific configurations.

Defining the Process Channel
Create a Phoenix Channel to handle real-time communications related to the Process resource.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony_web/channels/process_channel.ex

defmodule ServiceColonyWeb.ProcessChannel do
  use Phoenix.Channel

  alias ServiceColony.Process

  def join("process:lobby", _payload, socket) do
    {:ok, socket}
  end

  # Handle incoming messages to create a process
  def handle_in("create_process", %{"name" => name, "description" => description}, socket) do
    changeset = Ash.Changeset.for_create(%Process{}, :create, %{name: name, description: description})

    case Ash.Api.create(Process, changeset) do
      {:ok, process} ->
        broadcast!(socket, "process_created", %{id: process.id, name: process.name, description: process.description})
        {:reply, {:ok, %{id: process.id}}, socket}
      
      {:error, error} ->
        {:reply, {:error, %{error: error}}, socket}
    end
  end

  # Handle incoming messages to update a process
  def handle_in("update_process", %{"id" => id, "name" => name, "description" => description}, socket) do
    case Ash.Api.read_one(Process, %{id: id}) do
      {:ok, process} ->
        changeset = Ash.Changeset.for_update(process, :update, %{name: name, description: description})

        case Ash.Api.update(Process, changeset) do
          {:ok, updated_process} ->
            broadcast!(socket, "process_updated", %{id: updated_process.id, name: updated_process.name, description: updated_process.description})
            {:reply, {:ok, %{id: updated_process.id}}, socket}
          
          {:error, error} ->
            {:reply, {:error, %{error: error}}, socket}
        end

      {:error, error} ->
        {:reply, {:error, %{error: error}}, socket}
    end
  end

  # Handle incoming messages to delete a process
  def handle_in("delete_process", %{"id" => id}, socket) do
    case Ash.Api.read_one(Process, %{id: id}) do
      {:ok, process} ->
        case Ash.Api.destroy(Process, process) do
          {:ok, _deleted_process} ->
            broadcast!(socket, "process_deleted", %{id: id})
            {:reply, {:ok, %{id: id}}, socket}
          
          {:error, error} ->
            {:reply, {:error, %{error: error}}, socket}
        end

      {:error, error} ->
        {:reply, {:error, %{error: error}}, socket}
    end
  end

  # Additional handlers for other actions can be added here
end
Configuring the Endpoint and Router
Update UserSocket

Register the ProcessChannel in your UserSocket.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony_web/channels/user_socket.ex

defmodule ServiceColonyWeb.UserSocket do
  use Phoenix.Socket

  channel "service_agent:*", ServiceColonyWeb.ServiceAgentChannel
  channel "process:lobby", ServiceColonyWeb.ProcessChannel

  def connect(_params, socket, _connect_info) do
    {:ok, socket}
  end

  def id(_socket), do: nil
end
Configure the Endpoint

Ensure the socket is mounted in your endpoint configuration.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony_web/endpoint.ex

defmodule ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint do
  use Phoenix.Endpoint, otp_app: :service_colony_web

  socket "/socket", ServiceColonyWeb.UserSocket,
    websocket: true,
    longpoll: false

  # ... other configurations

  plug Plug.Static,
    at: "/",
    from: :service_colony_web,
    gzip: false,
    only: ~w(css fonts images js favicon.ico robots.txt)

  # ... remaining plugs
end
Update Router

Define necessary routes for Phoenix LiveDashboard or other interfaces as needed.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony_web/router.ex

defmodule ServiceColonyWeb.Router do
  use ServiceColonyWeb, :router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ["html"]
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_live_flash
    plug :protect_from_forgery
    plug :put_secure_browser_headers
  end

  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ["json"]
  end

  scope "/", ServiceColonyWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/", PageController, :index
    # Other routes
  end

  # Enable LiveDashboard in development
  if Mix.env() in [:dev, :test] do
    import Phoenix.LiveDashboard.Router

    scope "/" do
      pipe_through :browser
      live_dashboard "/dashboard", metrics: ServiceColonyWeb.Telemetry
    end
  end
end
Start Phoenix in Supervision Tree

Ensure Phoenix is started within your application's supervision tree.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/application.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      ServiceColony.Repo,
      ServiceColonyWeb.Telemetry,
      {Phoenix.PubSub, name: ServiceColony.PubSub},
      ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint,
      # Start Ash resources
      ServiceColony.Process,
      ServiceColony.Role,
      ServiceColony.Activity,
      ServiceColony.Task,
      ServiceColony.Scenario,
      ServiceColony.Step,
      ServiceColony.DataStructures
      # Other workers...
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: ServiceColony.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end

  def config_change(changed, _new, removed) do
    ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint.config_change(changed, removed)
    :ok
  end
end
Integrating Ash with Phoenix Channels
To enhance the intelligence and responsiveness of your communications layer, we'll integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into Phoenix Channels. This allows for intelligent processing and decision-making based on message content.

LLM Integration for Intelligent Processing
Add HTTP Client Dependency

We'll use httpoison for making HTTP requests to interact with the LLM API (e.g., OpenAI).

elixir
Copy code
# mix.exs

defp deps do
  [
    # ... existing dependencies
    {:httpoison, "~> 1.8"},
    {:jason, "~> 1.2"}
  ]
end
Run mix deps.get to install.

Create LLM Client Module

Implement a client to interact with the LLM API.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/llm_client.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.LLMClient do
  @moduledoc """
  Client to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) for message processing.
  """

  @api_url "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci/completions"
  @api_key System.get_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

  def process_message(content) do
    headers = [
      {"Content-Type", "application/json"},
      {"Authorization", "Bearer #{@api_key}"}
    ]

    body = %{
      prompt: content,
      max_tokens: 150
    }
    |> Jason.encode!()

    case HTTPoison.post(@api_url, body, headers) do
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: 200, body: response_body}} ->
        {:ok, response} = Jason.decode(response_body)
        choice = List.first(response["choices"])
        {:ok, choice["text"]}

      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: status_code, body: response_body}} ->
        {:error, %{status: status_code, body: response_body}}

      {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{} = error} ->
        {:error, error}
    end
  end
end
Note: Ensure you have your OpenAI API key set in the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY.

Service Agent Module

Modify the ServiceAgent to utilize the LLM for intelligent message processing.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/service_agent.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.ServiceAgent do
  use GenServer
  alias ServiceColony.LLMClient

  # Client API
  def start_link(initial_state) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, initial_state, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def send_message(to, subject, content) do
    Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(ServiceColony.PubSub, "process:lobby", %{
      to: to,
      subject: subject,
      content: content
    })
  end

  # Server Callbacks
  def init(state) do
    {:ok, state}
  end

  def handle_info(%{to: to, subject: subject, content: content}, state) do
    # Process message using LLM
    case LLMClient.process_message(content) do
      {:ok, response} ->
        # Send response back via Phoenix Channels
        send_response(to, subject, response)

      {:error, reason} ->
        IO.puts("LLM processing failed: #{inspect(reason)}")
    end

    {:noreply, state}
  end

  defp send_response(to, subject, response) do
    send_message(to, "#{subject}_response", response)
  end
end
Explanation:

send_message/3: Broadcasts a message to the process:lobby channel.
handle_info/2: Listens for incoming messages, processes them using the LLM, and sends responses.
Starting the Service Agent

Ensure the ServiceAgent is included in your supervision tree.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/application.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      ServiceColony.Repo,
      ServiceColonyWeb.Telemetry,
      {Phoenix.PubSub, name: ServiceColony.PubSub},
      ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint,
      ServiceColony.ServiceAgent,
      # Ash Resources
      ServiceColony.Process,
      ServiceColony.Role,
      ServiceColony.Activity,
      ServiceColony.Task,
      ServiceColony.Scenario,
      ServiceColony.Step,
      ServiceColony.DataStructures
      # Other workers...
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: ServiceColony.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end

  def config_change(changed, _new, removed) do
    ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint.config_change(changed, removed)
    :ok
  end
end
Creating a Nuxt.js Frontend for Monitoring and Interaction
To facilitate monitoring and interaction with the Service Colony, we'll develop a frontend using Nuxt.js. This dashboard will display real-time telemetry data and allow users to manage processes.

Initializing the Nuxt.js Project
Create a New Nuxt.js Project

bash
Copy code
npx create-nuxt-app service-colony-frontend
Follow the prompts to set up your project preferences.

Install Required Dependencies

Install phoenix-channels and axios for real-time communication and API interactions.

bash
Copy code
cd service-colony-frontend
npm install phoenix channels_socket.js axios
Setting Up Phoenix Channels in Nuxt.js
Create a Plugin for Phoenix Channels

javascript
Copy code
// plugins/phoenix.js

import { Socket } from "phoenix"

export default ({ store }, inject) => {
  const socket = new Socket("ws://localhost:4000/socket", {})
  socket.connect()

  const channel = socket.channel("process:lobby", {})

  channel.join()
    .receive("ok", resp => { console.log("Joined process:lobby successfully", resp) })
    .receive("error", resp => { console.log("Unable to join process:lobby", resp) })

  channel.on("process_created", payload => {
    store.commit("ADD_PROCESS", payload)
  })

  channel.on("process_updated", payload => {
    store.commit("UPDATE_PROCESS", payload)
  })

  channel.on("process_deleted", payload => {
    store.commit("DELETE_PROCESS", payload.id)
  })

  inject("channel", channel)
}
Register the Plugin in Nuxt Configuration

javascript
Copy code
// nuxt.config.js

export default {
  // ... existing config
  plugins: [
    '~/plugins/phoenix.js'
  ],
  // ... other configurations
}

<script>
import Dashboard from '~/components/Dashboard.vue'

export default {
  components: {
    Dashboard
  }
}
</script>
Vuex Store for Managing Processes
Set up a Vuex store to manage the state of processes.

javascript
Copy code
// store/index.js

export const state = () => ({
  processes: []
})

export const mutations = {
  ADD_PROCESS(state, process) {
    state.processes.push(process)
  },
  UPDATE_PROCESS(state, updatedProcess) {
    const index = state.processes.findIndex(p => p.id === updatedProcess.id)
    if (index !== -1) {
      state.processes.splice(index, 1, updatedProcess)
    }
  },
  DELETE_PROCESS(state, id) {
    state.processes = state.processes.filter(p => p.id !== id)
  }
}

export const actions = {
  // Define actions if needed
}

Explanation:

Day 1: The system operates normally with moderate CPU and memory usage.
Day 2: CPU usage spikes, triggering the Monitor Agent to request scaling up resources.
Day 3: After scaling, the system stabilizes with reduced CPU usage.
Day 4: Another spike in CPU usage prompts another scaling adaptation.
Day 5: The system maintains optimal performance without needing further adaptations.
Conclusion
By defining the Process resource using the Ash framework and establishing a real-time communications layer with Phoenix Channels, we have created a robust foundation for managing and interacting with Service Colonies. The integration with LLMs enhances the intelligence of the system, enabling proactive and adaptive behaviors based on telemetry data.

The synthetic logs demonstrate how the system can autonomously manage performance metrics, scaling resources as needed to maintain optimal operation. This setup not only ensures scalability and resilience but also fosters innovation and automation within distributed systems.

You said:
0:00:00 Alright guys, so today we're getting started on our DS-Pi powered, uhm, code assistant. So, if you're looking for somebody for full-time DS-Pi work, uh, please reach out.
0:00:15 I am available. So, let's get started. What we're working on right now is, I wanted to shout out these guys.
0:00:24 they came up with this thing called a code context file. Specification. So, Agentic Insights. Uhm, so, I came up, so yeah, it's a proposal for a flexible tool-agnostic code-based context system that helps teach AI coding tools about your code base.
0:00:45 Super easy to get started, just create a contact MD, the root of your project. right so the tooling that they have so far is a linter for it and so the linter actually has code to context in it so what we'll do is we'll go over what it is and then I'll go over my version right so you know env files editor
0:01:13 configs help shape your coding environment right because the I think the better one to think about is like the prettier RC file.
0:01:25 So let's look at dot RC file. Okay, so, for instance, in this, it's really describing how you code right what prettier will do is if you put in code that does not meet the standards, it will completely change your code and you'll be meeting the team standards.
0:01:52 So it provides the, you know, they use the word guardrails for like AI safety is very similar thing. And so you take this principle and then you apply it to the output, specifically in the arts context.
0:02:07 In our case, we will have it be, uhm, in a, in a specific format. So it's a really cool pattern.
0:02:16 Really like it. They actually have this prompt for, uhm, creating these files, right? And so, So, you know, as usual, I have a custom GPT for this, so if we go to chat, GPT.
0:02:32 I'll post the link for this, uhm, in the lounge. Custom meta prompt. Yeah, so, so this meta prompt is, uhm, empty.
0:02:49 Okay, uhm, we have a different one. Okay, sorry, codebase context assistant, right? So, this is, uhm, if we edit it and we look, We got a modified version of this prompt, right?
0:03:06 So, uhm, I'll share this. Uh, share. Copy link. We'll post this in the lounge. So we got the code, oh yeah.
0:03:21 So, we also have something that I created, similar to this, but actually like kind of next level. I call it the code blueprint, so let's see if we can Yeah.
0:03:35 Okay, so what the code blueprint does is, this is based initially off of Ager, but I mean, really it could be any project.
0:03:43 Uhm, you're basically describing specifically what you want the coding assistant to do, right? Created as part of the blueprint. The tool will ensure these files exist before proceeding with any operations.
0:03:58 files to edit. List of files that Code Generalization Tool will edit. These files are the focus of the tool's modifications or enhancements.
0:04:03 Uhm, read-only files considered for part of the context, right? Uhm, a test command, a link command, uhm, auto-commit, uh, you can provide additional, you know, any number of arguments, and then here you have this context files, right?
0:04:23 So, it's very specifically what we're talking about. So, I started taking this to the next level because Because what everybody lies with, You know, all these tutorial videos of people using, and we're just going to use Adr as an example, uhm, We'll go to the Adr, uhm, code, so, uhm, chat, examples, 
0:04:48 example chat, so we'll start here, right? So, this is not like how you would talk to a coder, like a human coder, right?
0:04:57 This is also one of the things that I always want to point out is the language model, excuse me, the language model already knows how to do this, right?
0:05:07 So this is not, one, nobody needs a Fibonacci endpoint, and, uhm, so let's open up the game, uhm, this is better, right?
0:05:20 Uhm, still, this is, this is not doing very much, right? Uhm, Multi-file change. Prompt to load. GetInputMockingFunctions. Okay, so then we're, uhm, this is closer, right?
0:05:37 But still, we're changing from a standard to something else. So, uhm, again, uhm, let me see. Sup, Karthik? Uhm, we're just going over, uhm, how Ada specifically works, and see you later.
0:05:56 Uhm, going over how Ada works so that we can then make our code blend. So, for instance, like, let's, let's take this.
0:06:05 Perfect example. Because this looks like a lot of, a lot of good stuff was getting done. So, if we copy all of this.
0:06:17 And we go to the code blueprint. Uhm, well, actually, we can do the code-based context assistant. So, we'll take this, and we'll say, uhm, Can you create a code base context file for this?
0:06:34 Let's see what it does. Okay. Structured overview. Command line interface interacts with users using prompt toolkit for input output has test case validity, right?
0:06:48 So, here, we're, we're getting the files, we're getting the technologies. Now, one of the things that we're gonna get into that, uhm, I discovered, or discovered, or really thought about, is one of the main problems that VMs always have is the version of software that they know about is almost always
0:07:08 different than the most recent version, or the most best practice version. So, I think that there's gonna be certain things that, if you want to get it to make what you want to make, you're gonna have to tell it ahead of time.
0:07:21 But the challenge is there's so much stuff that you need to tell it ahead of time that even this isn't, this is too high level, right?
0:07:29 It's Good, it's a great start. But it's still too high level. So now, let's go grab our Code Blueprint file.
0:07:38 And, uhm, we have these Enterprise Code Blueprints. So this is something we'll get into. So, Code Blueprint, this is kind of like your junior level, right?
0:07:48 It's just making the files. This Enterprise level, this is like senior level, right? Because at a senior level, sure, we're creating files read-only, but you also have to consider security, compliance, what it integrates.
0:08:02 And the Dependency Graph, Scaling Strategy, Deployment Strategy, Monitoring Requirements, Rollback Plan, Autolog, and Notification Channels, right? So, all of these things, you know, there might be more, but that's the, this is another piece of it, right?
0:08:19 These are things that you always have to consider when you're writing a new piece of code. This is very difficult to define for every single file, which is why we have this.
0:08:28 So, let's just grab this and go ahead and say, uhm, can you represent, can you represent the conversation and changes exactly as if the person was using Code Blueprint YAML files?
0:08:58 So, let's see what it looks like when you're using the Code Blueprint. Okay. Test main input output refactor, right?
0:09:12 So we got this files to create, test main, so let's see if, where it created that, right? Okay. Modify the test main file, okay.
0:09:27 So we'll have to change that. Well, so, one of the things is that actually, and this is a That's perfect.
0:09:32 Example is I have it, uhm, maybe, maybe not. We'll, we'll go into here and say, uhm, okay. So yeah, so it's not, uhm, oh yeah, files to edit.
0:09:47 Sorry, files to edit. Yeah, not files to create. Oh, well it has to create the test main. So we'll fix that, figure that out.
0:09:58 So then the context files. So even this, right, we're not using the test main. The specific blueprint. But if you think about it, like this is, and actually this is a good example, is this is helping provide a way of how it thinks about the project over time, right?
0:10:14 Final blueprint changes, right? So we can look at what it thinks about the process, right? And so we're not gonna get too far into this, but again if you think about it, right, these are all things that, you know, I bet you just, Usually if, like, somebody was writing a YouTube video, they actually probably
0:10:36 went through this a bunch of times to actually try and get it right, that they probably didn't get it right like this on the first shot.
0:10:43 Just my, my guess, uhm. So, this is a start, right? And we're gonna say, uhm, you got some of them wrong.
0:10:55 I need you to, uh, we can do a Say, uhm. First, provide the direct quote from the conversation between Adr and the user.
0:11:14 Then create the code blueprint that matches exactly. Right. We're getting much more specific. Even I'm getting more specific. Okay, so we got two things going on.
0:11:32 So here, okay, so here you notice it stopped doing the files to create problem.
0:11:44 So, it used text and then blueprint breakdown. So, in this case, it now makes it into one. Which is interesting.
0:12:06 It's close. So, it's, it grabbed one, so here it should be at least in terms of, Okay, yeah, see, so, uh, we can do it like this and then, heh, I'm getting this error, right?
0:12:22 Immediately it first gets an error. I made a mistake, right? Need to pass those input-output options, right? I'm getting this error.
0:12:30 So, you know just like even in the air aider documentation, like, three times the person has to tell it that it failed, right?
0:12:37 And so, we got this code blueprint and so this is good. We'll say I prefer this response and then, uhm, we can see, uh, how this would work, right?
0:12:49 So, what we'll do is we'll take this and actually that's one of the things is we'll just stick with this.
0:12:53 So, let, now let's go into the enterprise example. So now okay, now let's create the yaml file for the enterprise version of this conversation.
0:13:20 And so, we'll see what the enterprise version looks like to give you guys a different perspective. Okay, compliance with best practices.
0:13:32 Testability, scaling, and integration, right? So, if we look at it, so we got encryption, access control, integration points, dependency graph, scaling strategy.
0:13:53 So, for instance, we can go from the dependency graph and walk backwards to see, do any of these need to be changed, right?
0:14:00 monitoring requirements, notifications. e-mail and slack, right? GitHub actions. So, now, we have an idea of, and whether or not these are correct or not, we can, you know, play with the, the code blueprint, right?
0:14:16 So, now, if we go back, uhm, we didn't do the code blueprint, this one, sorry guys. Oh, you, but we're using the code-based context, GPT.
0:14:24 So, hopefully, this gives you guys a perspective of, like, these are, for me, if I'm programming this in an enterprise environment, uhm, these are all the things that I have to consider.
0:14:35 So, this is kind of where, uh, you know, where you get to, umm, you have entry level, you have senior, staff, principle, distinguished, architect, you know, a lot of these things.
0:14:49 So, once you start getting to the staff and above levels, these are things that you have to consider. Um, fortunately, there are things that maybe we can get automatically configured.
0:14:59 So, that's the code blueprint, right? Um, so, . And so, since we have the code blueprint, we can, um, get into running the code blueprint where we can make it with DSPY.
0:15:14 So, that's, that's one of the things that I'm doing here, um, I should be doing. Let's see, um, delete this.
0:15:23 This is from Running Ador. One of the, the things about all of this, is it always has to run on, uh, Foro Mini.
0:15:32 So. So it's a, it adds a very, a lot of degrees of difficulty, but it also makes you have to specify more what you want.
0:15:40 So there's like a, kind of like a double edge part to it. Um, okay. So you got this create code blueprint.
0:15:47 Um, create blueprint logic. So this is a blueprint command. So you can see this hello world. Um, see if we have the context.
0:15:58 Okay, this is the context as a string. Main. . So we have some other stuff we can work on. So let's get on the, the, um, coding assistant from DSP.
0:16:16 Alright, so. What we're going to do is we're going to start from a new CLI file. That's how I like to, to start these things.
0:16:28 So we have our, our main CLI. And so we're going to create a new key. Command um, and we're going to call it cd.dot.
0:16:39 founding. We're going to say , uh, some named, help. We'll just look at what we have. Okay, so there's a lot of stuff you can see I've been very busy.
0:16:56 Okay. So let's um, call assist. So we'll do, um. Mm. Sanjin, CMD, new, assist, um, assist, and then we'll say, um, blueprint.
0:17:23 Okay, so we got our assist sub-command created. Plug-ins, it's something new that I'm working on. Okay, so we have our assist, we have our blueprint.
0:17:36 Um, let's, uh, run it. Oops. So I'm getting used to working with, um, this. I'm using cursor.
0:17:49 Um, okay, so we're going to go here. We're going to Sanjin. Assist. Help.
0:18:03 Okay, so we got blueprint. Cool. Running the blueprint sub-command. Okay, so then let's create a unit test. So we go test commands.
0:18:20 And we'll just do a new file. Actually, let's see if, if, uh, oh yeah, we'll just do it here. Test.
0:18:29 Blueprint. CMD dot pi. Alright, so then let's do this here. Add, um, blueprint. Um, CMD.
0:18:44 Oh, wait, no, it's assist. Assist CMD. Um, and we'll rename this. Um, here we do it like this.
0:18:58 Thanks. So, we have our assist.
0:19:08 Um, we're gonna delete that. And actually what you can do here is you can split it. Right. Close it. Refresh.
0:19:23 There it goes. So then, um, delete that. Uh, create unit test. So, there we go. Um, okay. So then, we can, so I had some tests that weren't working. Um, so let's, let's do, um, how to watch commands. So in here we have this pyproject.toml.
0:20:00 We're gonna refresh this. And we're gonna say. We have our tasks, uh, docs, ppi.
0:20:13 Let's see, test. Dot test. Coverage, okay. So then what we're gonna say here, is we're gonna say, um, can you add a watch?
0:20:32 Watch is. So we need to add pi test watch.
0:20:58 Perfect. Okay, so, oh yeah, with this gherkin, we're doing, uh, business driven to- but it's cool that it's running. We'll just turn that off later.
0:21:07 Um, if that's not what we're learning, we're doing, uh, PA pi test. And what we'll do is we'll go to test generate gherkin.
0:21:26 whatever. We're not messing with it.
0:22:06 Alright. So then, we can do P-T-W. Okay. Potasks. Cool. So let's see if that works. And we'll open up the um, terminal.
0:22:26 Excuse me, terminal here, so we can make sure. So, Poe, watch. Okay, I did not add it. So that's actually one of the things about GPT4 Mini.
0:22:48 Is it doesn't, it only does like one thing. And maybe it did it and I didn't apply it, so. Tap open.
0:23:01 Oh, so maybe I didn't accept it. Oh, that's what it is. I'm just not fully active. Alright, so let's go find Task, Poe Task Watch.
0:23:15 Perfect. Let's try it again. There you go. Umm, this Test Assist command. Okay, so let's see what the exit code, so that was our new.
0:23:40 Umm, so what we can do, set a breakpoint, and umm, normally we can debug.
0:23:59 Otherwise, not see this test. See, this is one of those things, challenge, uhh, just that I have with cursor, but it's fine, because we can just go to here.
0:24:10 Umm, that is that. Test assist, set a breakpoint, debug contest. System exit 2, name file path. Okay, let's see what the result is.
0:24:27 Okay, blueprint options, so we have to do options, because if you, if we go back and look at it, um, test assist.
0:24:57 Command, we go to SRC, Sunjin, commands assist. Oh, it, one of the things is it, it, um, it, sometimes acts strange when you don't, when you only have one command, so let's add a command.
0:25:19 So, we'll go to here. Um, we can do that through the CLI, but let's just do it through here. Um, and we're gonna say, um, we're gonna reset.
0:25:31 And we're gonna say, um, add a command. Uh, run, um, that will run a blueprint. And we'll just add the blueprint, uh, models.
0:25:53 Okay, run a hater blueprint.
0:26:03 Perfect. Perfect. So, um, that's not what we want. We can say, um, instead, um, instead of the current arg, change it to file path with the- the default being.
0:26:56 So now, let's give it another run. Okay, so, it's still, um, failing. on? And we'll say, um, echo, str, and we'll just f.
0:27:20 Perfect. Alright. So. So, Cool. So yeah, we-we have to, we-we push the test. Okay. I don't know why it's giving eggs a 2.
0:27:54 But we're not gonna be debugging this today. This is why we're making the code system. So. We'll just keep on, So we'll check the result one more time.
0:28:09 Usage. Error. Missing argument echo. Alright. So. Results okay.
0:28:30 Let's go back. Do you want me to pause?
0:28:50 I won't say anything. Let's just say. This. Let's just find out where our little okay is. Just so that we can match that.
0:29:17 It's a two-ball. Standard out. Result that output.
0:29:48 So this is not how it works. Oh, no. Hey, shake. Can I shake my carrot? Sorry, this sounds. Shake. I'm sorry.
0:30:16 You want me to hit? Do you want me to hit? Do yourself? Yes. Just need time to take it out.
0:30:47 So actually, let's get, let's try eight or no. Let's see if some of these shut up. I'm set up Dr.
0:30:54 Vogel. Let's actually create a code blueprint for this.
0:31:09 Alright, so what we'll do is we'll take this output. Take this. And, um, I'll clients, except them all.
0:31:29 Okay, so, um, need to make some changes, uh, since t-t 2.5, uh, came in. Um, this root predict. Interesting. So, this is just me doing some testing.
0:31:45 So let's go to the code blueprint. Alright. So now we're saying, this, let's just see if from this, it can detect what's going on.
0:31:55 So, code blueprint command, it's got the command, the tests that command that's getting run, we don't have the file that this is defined in.
0:32:05 . . So we'll say, um, define in, uh, copy path reference, um, path from content, from source root.
0:32:18 No. Content root, because we're going to be running it in repository root. That's what it is, because that's what we're going to be running.
0:32:25 Alright. So what we're going to say is, um, create a basic code blueprint to fix. Let's see what it comes up with.
0:32:40 Um, so just to recap, Dr. Vogel, I came up with this, um, I don't know what to call a specification or something like that, but basically called a code blueprint.
0:32:55 I'll go from the top. So it's basically, um, a way to group tasks or files to be edited or create.
0:33:04 We'll see in the next from coding tools like Adr. And so what we're going to be doing is, um, we're going to be, there's something called a code context file, which is kind of on the macro level.
0:33:20 So we're going to be basically bridging the two. Um, and we're going to be kind of generating using, um, sungen to generate modules.
0:33:30 Uh, because basically, I don't think that we're ever going to get to the point where, an AI can figure out your code just because versions will be different and style will be different and stuff of that.
0:33:44 So what I think it'll be is that you'll have to build an entire code generator around your code base, which I guess could be done by an AI, which it will be done by an AI.
0:33:56 But it's a different paradigm, right? Like, it isn't just I'm going to be able to run a CLI. Well, I mean, one of generates everything you will be.
0:34:03 We'll just say the current paradigm by the current . . AI assistants, I don't think we'll scale. So we're coming at it from the other angle.
0:34:10 So let's see what we have coming generated. Alright, so what do we have? Um, failure and test blueprint command by fixing the output .
0:34:22 . current output running blueprint hello world. So a data match output subcommand blueprint, right? So even . . . in here, this isn't exactly what we want.
0:34:34 Want? So we have the message. Um, and so this is where we're expecting it to run the output of the test.
0:34:44 So, um, and again, one of the things about this, and actually I don't even . . we'll run it and then abandon it.
0:34:50 Cause this is kind of a trivial example. But then again, also an example of, like, how complicated it is just to describe something, uh, not working.
0:35:00 So here, and here it went into actually fixing the issue. What it thinks . . . fixing the issue. . What it looks like.
0:35:06 But let's run this blueprint. So we go to our, um, assist command. And then . . . All right, kit assist command will run the blueprint in the file.
0:35:26 So we'll just make this, uh . . . yaml. So in here we'll create new file blueprint. print. . . yaml. Um . . . And then I'm running a custom version of Adir that has a fix in it.
0:35:46 Um . . . We'll just make sure. Well, let's, let's run the one that's in here. I think, I don't know if it's the one I may touch or not, but whatever.
0:35:56 We will, um . . I think there's a way that I can tell. So we can go, uh, Adir, uh, version . . . Okay, so this is the, the Adir, the, the normal version.
0:36:10 So we're gonna be using the, um . . . the model as GPT-40 mini, for instance, and we'll see how it works. Um .
0:36:21 . . So we go . . . So . . . See ya. Assist, run, and see what happens. Okay. So it didn't echo anything. Um . . . Oh, that's because it didn't do anything.
0:36:40 Okay, so we have our, um . . . think it's in the . . . actually in the Hater project. So I have my . . I pulled down the Hater project.
0:36:49 Do a quick attach. Oh, you can't do that. Quick attach. Where is it? Attach. We'll go to dev. Hater. You can see, like, how it was creating all these files.
0:37:04 miles. Blueprints. Then we have this . . . oh, we're just attaching the Hater project, sorry. Um . . we're attaching Hater. Okay. So, um .
0:37:19 . Hater, if . . . you see how it does this stuff, this is because . . . when you're doing GPT-4, it takes it very literally.
0:37:30 Um . . . so actually what we can do is we can do, um . . . poetry. tree. Move Hater chat. Okay. It's not installed.
0:37:41 In the project, we can do, uh, uninstall . . . yes. Okay. So then what we'll do is we'll go to Hater. And let's just make sure that we have that change that I was talking about.
0:38:01 We go to Hater, go to Models, and let's just make sure that we have . . Mini . . . has a whole file . . . . . . sorry guys.
0:38:16 Okay. Yeah. Whole file editor. Cool. Alright. So that's, that's correct. Then we need to go to the whole file. The editor is in the coders.
0:38:27 Whole file coder. Uhm, prompts. So, um . . This is . . Oh, this functional prompts. Whole file prompts. Okay. So in here I had to do a get the get root, and then you see how it does path to example here.
0:38:46 Um, I had to do this thing where I say that replaced path to with the get root. So . . . you . . your results with editor may not be the same.
0:38:56 So . . . . . . probably won't be. But maybe it will. I don't know. Um, alright. So now what we can do is . . . since we're in here .
0:39:06 . we can do pip install e . . . hopefully this works. Okay. So you can see editor chat . . . 0.01. So let's go back into sun gen.
0:39:30 You can do, um, editor version . . . Okay, uhm, not found. I think it's oh, uhm, pip install . . . d e . . . . slash editor .
0:39:56 . . Okay. So this is, now, we're in the . . . The version of Python . . where we have . . Okay, unsolved . . . Okay, so yeah, I have Adir in here, um, but it should have it .
0:40:21 . . Oh, okay . . . Okay. So let's just say Adir . . . Okay, so it's broken . . . Alright. Uh . . Well, let's uninstall . . . Alright, we're not doing it either.
0:41:06 Oh, a I journey. We're doing our own DSPY version. Alright, perfect. Okay, so if we're doing that, then this is perfect.
0:41:16 Right? No longer . . . can no longer use their version. So . . what we're gonna do now is we will, um, separate the command from the execution.
0:41:29 So . . . we'll go here and we'll go to assist. and what we're doing. What gonna do is we're gonna actually do this.
0:41:39 We're gonna say, uh, def run equals underscore run. Right? Because what I wanna do is I wanna separate the, um .
0:41:50 . . the logic from the actual execution. I mean from the . . the CLI command. Basically, the thing that I want is I want it so that, um .
0:42:01 . . you're not . . . you're doing . . . you're checking the variables here. And, um . . you're doing the work over here. So for instance here, I don't have to worry about file path because .
0:42:14 . . file path will be coming in through here. And also we can say, um . . . equals . . . path. Um, we can do type er .
0:42:24 . . path. . . file. Um . . . let's see this. Let's do this. Um . . . change the . . . run. To use the . . . It works. So then, what we should be able to do is, um, we'll open up my blueprint.
0:43:14 Uh, this is not how you do it. Blueprint. Oh, we only have eight or blueprint in here. We can, does this?
0:43:46 Yeah, this is not the right version. So what we can do is we'll go back, um, to our chat. We'll go back and grab.
0:43:55 Okay, so we're in the sun-gen.
0:44:17 Where is it? So, now we've got Blueprint in here. So now we can do, um, bp equals.
0:44:35 tools. I don't know if that's how the yaml mixing works, do you know what?
0:44:57 Yaml tools yaml mixing from yaml is the actual correct one. Alright, so now we can go here. And we'll do Sunjin.
0:45:39 Assist, run. Okay. So, uh, oh, Blueprint.
0:45:50 Oh, Blueprint. Subtract. Subtract. Alright. Sorry. It's assist. Wait. Sunjin. and Okay.
0:46:30 Umm, I messed up. Okay. Yeah. Dog isn't having a rough time. Okay.
0:46:42 Umm, serve call. WOAH! Shh. Shh. That should be- it should still be fine. Okay. Perfect. Okay. So, umm, Typer has no thing path.
0:47:05 Okay. Typer file path. There you go. Oh yeah! So, actually one- what you're seeing here is um, this error analysis- so I actually- this is cool.
0:47:19 Um, I- I created in the CLI command. This thing where- if there's a global error, we handle it.
0:47:32 And it actually goes to the language model. And runs it. . . And you can see error analysis and fix suggestions. So that's what this is.
0:47:44 So, type our file path. So again, this is the- the thing about, you know, even in cursor, the GPT-40-mini isn't trustworthy.
0:48:00 Which is good that I have a- a double check. File path. . . . Maybe that's . . . not defined. Let's . . . ok, now let's mess it up.
0:48:27 Let's mess it up. So, let's go to the GPT-40. And so, this is exactly why I'm doing this. And it's hard, and it would be way easier, and also way more .
0:48:38 . expensive to do this with, um, GPT-4. But, you know, the people, a lot of people can't really afford . . for . . . or whatever.
0:48:49 So, here it's doing the blueprint. We just need something that, um, is normal. Oh yeah, we got the new models out there, but we'll just do four.
0:49:01 We'll say, um, can you fix . . . . . . Okay, so yeah, it's, Oh . . . recursive . . . ok. So, let's see what the correct version looks like .
0:49:20 . . . ok. So, it's doing argument which is not . . what we want . . and so it's, I . . . . , . wanted to validate the file that exists.
0:49:37 So, even still, here . . it's not doing what I want it to do . . . right? It still doesn't get the picture. So, this is exactly why we're coming at it from this high level perspective and drilling down .
0:49:51 . . because I think that's . . . ok. See, so, Typer has a way to do this . . . umm, Typer . . . . and so, this is a perfect example where, like, for instance, I needed to look up .
0:50:03 . . um, but also, I haven't told it what I want . . you know, that's all those things . . . where does it learn . . . um, path .
0:50:20 . . ok, so here's . . . here's what it is . . . file paths . . . ok . . . so, optional . . . but we'll just start off with . . . um . . . see, so it's even .
0:50:37 . it's way simpler . . then even any of this stuff . . . so, go back here . . . and, like, who knows if this stuff . . . like, what this stuff even is .
0:50:50 . . so . . . final . . . now, the reason why it's using this old version of the code is they have this thing called the, um .
0:50:59 . . shadow DOM . . . so, path . . . equals . . . . . . yeah, let's go back . . sorry guys . . um, . so let's just start here . . . now we're on track .
0:51:26 . . path . . . and code . . this takes path . . . um . . from YAML . . . which is the YAML code . . and it creates an instance of the pyaniic model.
0:51:42 Yeah, and the CLS is itself . . . um . . . and so it shows the string, but it'll . . string . . . it'll change it to a path .
0:51:51 . so anyway, let's go back to here . . . . ok, perfect . . so I read the blueprint . . . . and again, still wrong information . . so we'll have to figure that out as well .
0:52:11 . . . alright, so let's . . let's run it . . . . . what we need to do is . . and we'll just start building this . . . um, from scratch .
0:52:22 . so let's start with . . . actually, in the ADOR project, I have . . . . how to run it . . so what we're going to grab is we're just going to grab how ADOR runs this file .
0:52:35 . . the blueprints . . this create command . . . because here it has, um, the logic . . so, you know, for instance, file creation, if it doesn't exist .
0:52:48 . . you know, auto-test all this stuff . . so we're just going to take . . . all of this . . . and we're going to strip out the ADOR parts .
0:52:57 . . hopefully, we'll get it to work . . . . and actually what we can do is we can just leave that there as reference .
0:53:05 . so we can say . . 4 . . . to create . . . we can say . . . create the files . . . let's see if this works . . . ok . . . so here, for instance, it didn't do the .
0:53:34 . . um . . didn't do the . . space correctly . . alright . . alright guys . . . you're watching me learn, in real time . . . alright . . . alright . . now we have to create the files if it does not exist .
0:54:07 . . ok . . . so, let's . . . um . . . actually let's create a . . . duplicate of this situation . . . um . . so what we'll do is we'll create a new command .
0:54:23 . what we'll call it . . . . . create . . . okay . . . so now we have this create command . . and so, um . . . actually, what we can do is .
0:54:54 . . we can take this and create a blueprint of it . . . so what we'll do is . . . have the . . . . . . I have a blueprint .
0:55:07 . . code blueprint, uhh, gpt . . okay, so what we're going to say is, we're just going to take what's already here. Now one of the things that is going to be like a philosophy of mine is always using code generator first.
0:55:23 And so that's another aspect of . . . code assistant that we're trying to make is that the code assistant I actually wanted to make templates, not fixed bugs .
0:55:34 . . which is actually what we're doing right now. But we're building the code generator . . context, that's what we're working on. We have to get some tools going for that.
0:55:43 So, um, we're creating the context. Um, so actually, you know what? We're going to make it get it to the point where we can create these context files.
0:55:54 We're not going to worry about the . . . well, we're going to get to the generators first, then we'll get to fixing files and stuff like that.
0:56:01 That, I think will work. Cause otherwise you can go down a rabbit hole of, uh, all that other kind of stuff.
0:56:09 That's all right. The whole thing, right? The, there's a book that I like thin air, where it talks about like nanotechnology and things like that, where he says, you know, no matter what it is, it's always faster and cheaper to build it from scratch than it is to change what's already there.
0:56:27 So, that's going to be the philosophy. There you go. That's the first philosophy of the DSPY code generator. So, um.
0:56:36 So, let's go tell the AI that. I think that's a good thing. . . . to start working on. So, we're going to go to the code context.
0:56:44 Code-based context. And what we're going to say is, um, I would like to create a code generator that first generates code-based context files.
0:56:58 Period. One of the philosophies of this generator code assistant is that it always builds everything from scratch. It does. do not edit existing files.
0:57:15 Why might I have that philosophy? Yeah. Exactly. That's one of the things is that even if your editor, for instance, or your agent zero, or your whatever, even if the unit tests pass, can you trust that code that it created?
0:57:52 No matter what, you're always going to have to check it. Whereas if you trust your code generators, you don't have to check it because it's generated at the same time.
0:58:01 So yeah, infrastructure is code mindset. Continuous delivery-friendly. Yeah, so exactly. We're making the actual creation of the code, like the CI-CD pipeline, because that's what that is.
0:58:18 And that actually I think makes perfect sense. And also we're getting, in terms of complexity of the tools, closer and closer to that.
0:58:26 Right? Um. So yeah, so that's what we're going to do. So now, what we're going to do is, we're going to give it the blueprint.
0:58:36 Actually, we're going to take the code-based context and turn it into Python. I'd end this model. So that's what we're going to do first.
0:58:41 So let's go to the code-based context. I've got too many. Okay, we've got code-based context. And so, what we're going to do is we're going to generate the context prompt.
0:58:53 And actually, instead of generating, um, on Titanic models first, actually, I think that would be easier because then we could do DSPI signatures, but I think understand stampede active model stress.
0:59:07 Let's continue. Invert the machine readable parts of the code-based context into pedantic models. Because I have something that uses structured outputs.
0:59:23 So, um, we'll do that first. Yeah, we'll get the code-based context generating. Then, because that's the thing, is imagine if I can generate 100 code context files, instantly, we can feed that into code generators.
0:59:40 . Right? Okay. So, one of the things we need to do is we're gonna say, um, I need to have verbose dockstrings for the class.
0:59:51 Period. Do not put the arguments in the class dockstring. Each attribute of the model needs to have a field with a description.
1:00:10 That provides context to another code generator. Right? Gotta eat our own dog food. So, we don't need this e-mail extra and so, uh, no examples.
1:00:27 So, it's gonna take its time, whatever. See, it already stopped. Didn't pay attention. And we'll do it in all caps.
1:00:45 Do not put the argument attributes. Did you say attributes or argu- attributes? Oh, and I put the K in there.
1:01:01 Again. Even GPT4 not following directions.
1:01:18 So, and then it's still not following directions. Because also we'll be able to turn these pedantic models into signatures if we want to.
1:02:03 Which is actually probably what we'll want to do anyway. I have a really cool method of doing concurrent, uh, signatures as well.
1:02:09 That is That is all right. I might get into. But this is also good because this allows us to have our code assistant not be in the business of making working code.
1:02:20 We can leave that to the very, very end. So, for instance, we can have it make diagrams. You know, all of these really interesting kind of pieces.
1:02:54 Alright, so now we have a really well documented, um, piece here so then we can go to here. And we have that command that got created.
1:03:06 Now one of the things is I'm creating commands here. But I also have for Sanjin and- entire plug-in system. So you can see actually I was starting the blueprints as a plug-in.
1:03:16 But right now we're gonna keep it simple to where it's a command. And then if we want to, we can make it into a, um.
1:03:26 Sorry, make it into a, um. Plug-in later. Alright, so actually we need to change our template. So it's def. Def create.
1:03:39 8. Alright, so then we have in here, our models here. Um, so we have a new file and we're gonna call it code context.
1:04:04 So we have our, our code context. Alright, cool. So, I can already look- at this and know that with GPT4 this is way too big for it to create.
1:04:16 So what we're gonna do is we need to come up with a signature that describes each one of these. So what we're gonna do is f- we're not gonna go into these first.
1:04:29 What we're gonna do is we're gonna grab this and we're gonna go to our signature generator. Which is one of my numerous, um, GPTs.
1:04:41 Alright, and we're gonna say, um, I need one signature that generates the requirements for each one of these arguments and attributes.
1:05:02 Let's see if it's able to figure that out. Okay, so. Input. So, we'll be able to change that. Um. Perfect.
1:05:25 Yeah. And so, what we can do is, we'll say also that, um, even though the output field is there, it's, um, here it's making, yeah.
1:05:41 So, this is not what we, so the thing is what we're saying is, um, we are going to be giving epics from a JIRA issue and need to have the context file created from that text period.
1:06:09 Also, in the, uh, the output description include, on average, how many of the things will be created and mention whether or not it'll be a list.
1:06:21 Period. But keep the input fields and output fields that just have descriptions. Right, I don't, I don't want it to all of a sudden be putting different kinds of, it's construction here.
1:06:38 And we can just put desk. Yeah. See, so yeah, we're going to change the gear, ehm, epics, right. We're going to give it a bunch of stories and you know, we're going to say what the executives want.
1:07:06 And then we're going to create the code-based context based on that. I think that will work well. Cool, so let's now say that, um.
1:07:21 Oh, I know what we're going to do. We're going to go to the con-code-based, because let's go check the read-me of the specification, because what they have here is a linter, and let's now change it to a template generator, something like that, right.
1:07:36 So, um. We're just going to grab all this. Right? And we're going to say, um. Do this. Sorry, I got so many screens.
1:07:51 Let's, let's start chopping these down. That's the one we're working on. This, this. I've been very busy. We got a lot of really cool stuff coming up, so we just need to get through these basics, and then.
1:08:10 Perfect. Alright. . . . So what we're going to say is, um, now, uh, convert this to the epics for a code-based context generator.
1:08:28 Start simple. Yup. Okay, so it's not, uh, no.
1:08:55 Uh, context library, that'll be interesting. So no, it's, it's, uh, uh, no. It's, um, generator. So we can say linter, linter is already done.
1:09:10 So let's just say that we, we are just working on the generator. No other projects are in scope.
1:09:26 Talk to it like a product manager. So, we're, we're, it's interesting, right? Okay, populated version from reading from package managers.
1:09:54 That's a good one. I like that. Advanced context generation. And so, what's good is that here, one of the things that we want to kind of notice is it's talking about, we're going to be giving that information to it.
1:10:11 So. Now, we just need a meta, we'll call it a meta generator, that handles this next level. Umm, and we'll leave that.
1:10:22 So, because that's the thing is we want the meta generator. We want to be able to, to say from very, umm, very limited text just to get us started.
1:10:32 So, we're going to say, umm, we want a meta generator that will take a couple of sentences. Yes. Yes. This is, and generate all of the requirements for the generator above.
1:10:50 Period. The meta generator will use large language models to generate the text and diagrams using mermaid.js.
1:11:07 And C4 DSL. . Yeah. Perfect. Now the meta generator is what we actually wanted. Umm, so let's see if we can create the epics.
1:11:36 Oh, cool. So actually it went straight for the signature. So it's fun- So finally is actually the signature is kind of the- the example of- it's very similar to that.
1:11:51 So- so it's actually- but yeah, see, a di- it generates a diagram, it denivates a DSL. This is perfect, right?
1:12:00 So now we've got the meta generator. So now we connect the meta generator. So then actually it lets- . Well, this- we- we can just give it as the epic.
1:12:14 So this- this output, we can turn into the epic. So then let's take, uhm, we'll say, uhm, create- create a ginger template.
1:12:34 This is actually a pattern I was thinking about. Template that converts the- result. The response. Outputs. of generate requirements.
1:12:57 And, uhm, converts them. So this is actually an intermediate step that we don't need. Oh, well, no, actually we need this for the code generation.
1:13:10 So this is a good- we're now getting into- Thank you. This is actually exactly what I was talking about, right?
1:13:14 We go signature to template generator, and then we're gonna go to signature, but we can also do, um, well, I have the entire DSL as well, but we're gonna work with the class version for right now.
1:13:27 But that's how we're gonna really scale this up. Um, alright. So we create the just- the response outputs generate and converts, um.
1:13:42 Get into the JIRA, JIRA epics for the- generate project horn. It's interesting. Let's see how it works.
1:14:24 No, so this is- this is not correct. So let's go back a second. So we'll- we'll say here, user stories.
1:14:34 Yeah, product description, user stories, workflow diagram, architecture diagram. Okay, so- so the- um, oh, well yeah, it's mermaid. So this is actually correct.
1:14:46 And if we don't need this explanation of template, so let's- let's kind of start breaking this down. So we're gonna have, um, what are we gonna call it?
1:14:57 We're gonna call it, um, epic template. We have, um, epic TMPL. And we're just gonna delete. We'll see in the next So we have our JIRA templates, right?
1:15:26 This epics, we don't have this anywhere. So we're gonna just say, um.
1:15:44 We'll just call this user story. And then the, yeah, the, the epic will be described. Here, perfect. Okay, so now let's just create in here a main function.
1:16:01 Um. And I have some custom libraries, which is why I'm, um. Um, Not going to be using, um, cursor right now?
1:16:19 Okay, so, We got the llama, we're gonna switch to DSPy, which reminds me, we need to switch, well, actually no, it, it, it's already, um, 2.5, because it's complaining, if you remember already complaining about something.
1:16:38 Alright, we got our init DSPy, so what we're gonna do, U is, we're gonna take our signature back up here, not here, our signature here, back up here, and we're gonna say, um, generate requirements.
1:16:57 Right? And so, we have our, uh, we'll just put it, template above it. Okay. And we'll import. . Alright, cool. There we have our imports.
1:17:16 So then we have our, um, I had, like, uh, I created some new utilities. Um, let's go find them.
1:17:27 D-s. That's not it. Utilities. D-s by tools. Alright, so we got this predict type. It was a bunch of, like, typed stuff.
1:17:39 Um, and it predict type. pipe. But our string runs predict returns this specified output argument. Right. Um, predict types.
1:17:52 That wasn't it. This is some cool stuff with the, uh, so let's just make, um, uh, death predict. Sick. And we'll just say, um, input.
1:18:09 Dictionary. So actually, we'll do it this way. So, take this, we'll delete this. What we'll do is we'll grab all this, and we'll just put it down here, and say, um, I would like function called, um, and we'll go grab the- signature from the DSPY here, and we'll say, um, yeah, uh, actually, yeah, we'll
1:18:59 grab this, and we'll say, uh, because I just want to make it, like, super, not dumb, but, you'll see, um, that.
1:19:12 You can take a, uhm, we also need, uhm, we need a particular sig, because I want it to be, like, really, um, basic.
1:19:31 So, it can take a signature class or string, uh, a input, um, uh, string, or dict, and return the forward.
1:20:02 We'll just see what it creates. I just want, like, one function I can just run. Let's see how it designs it.
1:20:28 So you can just give it a signature, and then put data as a type or a string, and it just handles it.
1:20:47 And we'll start here. And we can, we'll just, let's just start chopping this up. Because we don't want to return a dictionary, we want to return.
1:21:04 Well, no, that, it's always a dictionary. Um, but we just wanted to return the output. So, um. . . Let's, um, let's always assume one.
1:21:26 And this will make it easier once we get to the yaml versions of this. Assume one output. And, um, no typed predictors.
1:21:57 Okay, and so we don't want the dictionary, and we'll say, um, you know, just return the, uh, um, what does it look like, um, pre-dot, dot.
1:22:08 Uh, I think it's like, Thank much for in the get ATR. Oh yeah, get attribute, and it's so, um, I'll put fields.
1:22:25 Uh, we'll see how it works. Uh, I need to let the dot go. So, cause I've actually done this before.
1:23:12 Cause we have the output. Key? Umm, no. No, to get the output key and return that string.
1:24:24 Yeah, this should be exactly what we need. So let's give it a shot. Perfect signature. Oh, I already had one?
1:24:37 Oh, no, it's because there's a bad one. I'll just, We got it pretty sick, and then we can go grab the mains.
1:24:54 Yeah, we can do it in the main. And actually we can use a llama. See how that works. Maybe it works better now.
1:25:04 Like, Okay, cool. Oh, it's already, Doesn't need to resolve itself if it's already there. So let's see. . Okay, that worked.
1:25:31 So then we got our, umm, our second main. So we'll just do, uhh, main two. Okay, so I didn't find the output field.
1:26:07 Let's just find the output field ourselves. Okay, so we got our signature.
1:26:28 When we look at it. Field, DSPY field type. Umm. Yeah, it's, so a signature.
1:26:51 It's a signature meta. Come new. Let's see. See you. fields, items. Okay, that's what we need, model fields, items. And we'll go and check it.
1:27:51 We'll just, uhh, uhh, uhh, not return anything for right now.
1:28:19 And we'll say, signature. And we'll say, umm, print, name, field.
1:28:39 And we'll just do, to end it, print, hello. And we can just stop. Perfect. Alright, field info. Annotations required. DSPY, field type.
1:29:01 So we can say, umm. And we'll say, umm. The . . . . And instead of, like, complaining, we'll just take the . . . ah, So we'll say, uhh, field .
1:29:23 . . umm. DSPY, field . . . type . . . is . . what I think we'll do, umm, if . . . type . . is output . . . . output . . . key. That's what we call it up there.
1:30:01 Now, equals . . field . . . and that should be name . . . name . . . name . . and then we say, um, and then we already have it, so then we just return, um, because we've already done the prediction.
1:30:40 We do the prediction here. Yeah, we do the prediction . . and then we just return, uh, prediction . . . get, uh, name . . . . There we go.
1:30:57 Let's see if that works. Else, um, else . . I mean, then it's otherwise raise value error. Uh, something, uh, so . . It's like, output .
1:31:19 . . not . . . Oh no, it should just have an output, whatever. So, there we go. Alright. Cool. So we stop . . . Oh, okay, so yeah, is .
1:31:38 . . I've been doing Python for a while, I always forget whether or not it's . . . if or . . Alright, console . . . okay, field info .
1:32:01 . . that's strange . . . field . . . . . . what was that . . . okay, JSON schema extra . . . okay, that might be what we look at . . . oh, it's hidden because it's .
1:32:36 . . okay, we'll just do that . . . uhh . . . get . . . play rate 7 appearances. experiences. Perfect. So now, I have something where I can just go back here, and while I'm playing around, just go in and say, alright, um, predict, um, what was it, SIG?
1:33:37 And we can just say, um, generate requirements, and, our input . . Data is . . um, where is it? I'll go back up here.
1:33:56 To our other conversation. We were talking to it about . . . oops . . . code-based context . . . Where is it? Okay, here it is. I guess .
1:34:42 . it was . . . All right. So, what's All right. All right. Did you erase the history? No. No. Okay. Metagenorator requirements creation.
1:34:55 Yeah. Here we go. All right. So then when we say, um . . . Go in here, and we just say, um . . And we just say, um .
1:35:24 . . What are we calling it? Well wait, so if we're doing generate requirements, it generates a whole bunch of stuff. So we don't want just this one.
1:35:33 What was it up here creating? Oops. So, we'll just do . . . Oh. Instead of that . . . um . . . We'll just do this . . . 3 .
1:35:50 . And up here we'll do . . . oops . . . Yeah . . . 3 . . . actually what we want, we did want it to provide the dictionary of outputs.
1:36:14 Um . . and put, uh, predict, uh, sig . . . actually what we can do, do we have predict . . . I think I had predict types .
1:36:32 . . string string . . . okay, yeah, so . . . so what we want, actually, yeah, we have type . . . okay, we just want dict. That's what it is.
1:36:43 So we already had predict string . . . we're just messing around with dict. So . . we want to do is just . . . return the prediction .
1:36:56 . . here is class . . . and we're just . . . it doesn't matter what it is . . we're just going to return the dict . . . . There we go.
1:37:19 Alright. Well, it does predict . . . oops . . . we're just going to worry about this one. Output . . and we're just going to say .
1:37:46 . . . . h equals . . . dspi . . . output field . . . . desk. And we're actually going to even need to put the field, so we'll just say .
1:38:00 . . dict . . . result . . . prediction . . . and so we can do a result . . . um, age . . . 21 . . . answer . . . there we go. Perfect. Okay, so now we have the dictionary that outputs .
1:38:40 . . predict . . dict . . and then we'll say . . . X equals . . . print . . . print . . . . Alright, result is we didn't change the file when we were doing context.
1:39:29 This is where we're debugging. Input must be a dictionary. No, that's not what we want. That's not what we want.
1:39:52 We want it to be a string. Cuz the input will be a string. Let's see who jumped in. Maybe they jumped out already.
1:40:05 I don't know what those sounds mean. Maybe one day I'll learn those sounds. No, we got S-P-D-E-37. What's up? I'm not a predict model.
1:40:20 Umm. Well, we have string if we're doing string, so this'll be, one of the input data could be a string.
1:40:36 So if it's string, we have one input. Yeah. Uhm. So if we have string, sub class signature does, So we can say, if, if this is a dictionary, um, we, no matter what we, we set up the signature with the class, then if it's a dictionary, we do this, the... else, if, predict, prediction, equals, umm, predict
1:41:33 model, umm, and it's, the keyword argument is, the input data? You know, the, yeah, the keyword argument, so the, umm, so we'll say, uh, quarn.
1:41:59 Yeah, quarn, equals a dict, where, the, I don't know how to do this with, can you do this with a dictionary?
1:42:15 Let's see. Name of value pairs, Because what we want is, Oh!
1:42:36 Oh, I know! Yeah, with, what it is, is this. The key is the, umm, the input, The key.
1:42:47 So, we'll do, It's the reverse of this. I should stop playing around with this. Umm, Alright, so we'll just do the, the normal, umm, the normal way of doing this.
1:43:07 So, we'll just do, umm, So that's one of those things, right? There's like, I've been playing around with it, and it hasn't been working, so we'll just do predict.
1:43:16 And we'll do, . Uhh, project description, equals this. Umm, equals, uhh, what was it? We were calling it, input string or something?
1:43:32 Yeah, input, string, .forward. Why are we getting that here? Signature unfilled. Oh! Yeah, sorry. It's, this part is general requirements.
1:43:57 And this part is this. Alright. So now, playing around too much. But that's fine, right? The, I say playing around too much, but at the same time I'm learning the restrictions, the requirements, we're gonna delete that.
1:44:19 . We're also learning the limitations of myself as a program. And why we're building tools. In the first place. I'm doing it so that you don't have to.
1:44:29 So what we're gonna do is we're just gonna delete, this anyway. Delete that. Delete that. Okay. Yeah, we're just gonna use this.
1:44:42 Cause, I mean, I already have the DSL. I have all this stuff. One of the things also is that I have so many, tools that I've already built that determining which ones to use is a challenge in of itself.
1:44:54 And it's, uh, let's try it again. Just thinking about it. Uh, thinking about it.
1:45:25 Oh, okay. No, yeah, that's okay. Great. So what it was doing, perfect. So now we got a, Oh, great. Yeah.
1:45:31 No, this is perfect. It really, it really went. Okay, so let's, let's, we got generated requirements. Functional requirements. Detect project dependencies.
1:45:45 Build dot gradle. Output directory. Generate user story diagrams and workflows. Yeah, uh, workflow diagram.
1:45:58 So we can, uh, awesome. So let's just grab this. And instead of this, um, we can just do, um, oops.
1:46:13 Not that. Okay, now we have our requirements. Dictionary, right? So we paste this down. Instead, we say, um, this. This.
1:46:25 This. This. This. This. This. Actually, we have a munch. This allows us to do JavaScript style. Uh, so we'll say, Rex equals munch.
1:46:44 Munch. Do this. Do this. All right, now we have an appropriate munch. We're gonna fill the paragraph. Fill the paragraph.
1:47:02 And so what we're gonna do is we're going to go check to see if these, um, work. So we're gonna print out the workflow diagram.
1:47:13 So, um, So. . . . .

Completing the Loop with PLAN Service Colonies
To complete the loop started in your transcript within the PLAN Service Colonies architecture, we'll integrate the Ash Resources, Phoenix Channels, LLMs, and the Nuxt.js Frontend to establish a seamless, real-time, and intelligent communication and processing system. This loop ensures that user interactions on the frontend are processed by the backend resources, enhanced by AI, and updates are communicated back to the frontend in real-time.

Overview of the Loop
Frontend (Nuxt.js):

User interacts with the dashboard to create, update, or delete processes.
Sends requests via Phoenix Channels to the backend.
Communications Layer (Phoenix Channels):

Receives messages from the frontend.
Routes messages to appropriate backend services or Ash Resources.
Backend (Ash Resources and LLMs):

Ash Resources handle CRUD operations on Process and related resources.
LLMs process and analyze data as needed, providing intelligent responses or actions.
Real-Time Updates:

Backend services broadcast updates via Phoenix Channels.
Frontend receives updates and reflects changes instantly.
Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Define Service Modules to Bridge Ash Resources and Phoenix Channels
To facilitate communication between Ash Resources and Phoenix Channels, we'll create service modules that listen for events and handle message routing.

a. Process Service Module
This module will handle actions related to the Process resource and communicate with Phoenix Channels.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/services/process_service.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.Services.ProcessService do
  use GenServer
  alias ServiceColony.Process
  alias ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint

  # Client API
  def start_link(_opts) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{}, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  # Server Callbacks
  def init(state) do
    # Subscribe to PubSub topics related to Process
    Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(ServiceColony.PubSub, "process_updates")
    {:ok, state}
  end

  def handle_info({:process_created, process}, state) do
    # Broadcast to Phoenix Channels
    Endpoint.broadcast!("process:lobby", "process_created", %{
      id: process.id,
      name: process.name,
      description: process.description
    })
    {:noreply, state}
  end

  def handle_info({:process_updated, process}, state) do
    Endpoint.broadcast!("process:lobby", "process_updated", %{
      id: process.id,
      name: process.name,
      description: process.description
    })
    {:noreply, state}
  end

  def handle_info({:process_deleted, process_id}, state) do
    Endpoint.broadcast!("process:lobby", "process_deleted", %{id: process_id})
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
b. Integrate Process Service in Supervision Tree
Ensure that the ProcessService is started alongside other services.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/application.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      ServiceColony.Repo,
      ServiceColonyWeb.Telemetry,
      {Phoenix.PubSub, name: ServiceColony.PubSub},
      ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint,
      ServiceColony.Services.ProcessService,
      # Ash Resources
      ServiceColony.Process,
      ServiceColony.Role,
      ServiceColony.Activity,
      ServiceColony.Task,
      ServiceColony.Scenario,
      ServiceColony.Step,
      ServiceColony.DataStructures,
      ServiceColony.ServiceAgent
      # Other workers...
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: ServiceColony.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end

  def config_change(changed, _new, removed) do
    ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint.config_change(changed, removed)
    :ok
  end
end
2. Update Phoenix Channels to Handle Ash Resource Events
Modify the ProcessChannel to handle incoming messages and trigger Ash Resource actions, as well as receive broadcasts from the ProcessService.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony_web/channels/process_channel.ex

defmodule ServiceColonyWeb.ProcessChannel do
  use Phoenix.Channel
  alias ServiceColony.Process
  alias Ash.Changeset
  alias Ash.Api

  def join("process:lobby", _payload, socket) do
    {:ok, socket}
  end

  # Handle incoming messages to create a process
  def handle_in("create_process", %{"name" => name, "description" => description}, socket) do
    changeset = Changeset.for_create(%Process{}, :create, %{name: name, description: description})

    case Api.create(Process, changeset) do
      {:ok, process} ->
        # Publish to PubSub so that ProcessService can broadcast
        Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(ServiceColony.PubSub, "process_updates", {:process_created, process})
        {:reply, {:ok, %{id: process.id}}, socket}

      {:error, error} ->
        {:reply, {:error, %{error: error}}, socket}
    end
  end

  # Handle incoming messages to update a process
  def handle_in("update_process", %{"id" => id, "name" => name, "description" => description}, socket) do
    case Api.read_one(Process, %{id: id}) do
      {:ok, process} ->
        changeset = Changeset.for_update(process, :update, %{name: name, description: description})

        case Api.update(Process, changeset) do
          {:ok, updated_process} ->
            Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(ServiceColony.PubSub, "process_updates", {:process_updated, updated_process})
            {:reply, {:ok, %{id: updated_process.id}}, socket}

          {:error, error} ->
            {:reply, {:error, %{error: error}}, socket}
        end

      {:error, error} ->
        {:reply, {:error, %{error: error}}, socket}
    end
  end

  # Handle incoming messages to delete a process
  def handle_in("delete_process", %{"id" => id}, socket) do
    case Api.read_one(Process, %{id: id}) do
      {:ok, process} ->
        case Api.destroy(Process, process) do
          {:ok, _deleted_process} ->
            Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(ServiceColony.PubSub, "process_updates", {:process_deleted, id})
            {:reply, {:ok, %{id: id}}, socket}

          {:error, error} ->
            {:reply, {:error, %{error: error}}, socket}
        end

      {:error, error} ->
        {:reply, {:error, %{error: error}}, socket}
    end
  end

  # Additional handlers can be added here
end
3. Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) for Enhanced Processing
Incorporate LLMs to provide intelligent processing and responses based on the interactions within the Service Colony.

a. LLM Client Module
Ensure you have an LLM client module to interact with the AI models.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/llm_client.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.LLMClient do
  @moduledoc """
  Client to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) for message processing.
  """

  @api_url "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci/completions"
  @api_key System.get_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

  def process_message(content) do
    headers = [
      {"Content-Type", "application/json"},
      {"Authorization", "Bearer #{@api_key}"}
    ]

    body = %{
      prompt: content,
      max_tokens: 150
    }
    |> Jason.encode!()

    case HTTPoison.post(@api_url, body, headers) do
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: 200, body: response_body}} ->
        {:ok, response} = Jason.decode(response_body)
        choice = List.first(response["choices"])
        {:ok, choice["text"]}

      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: status_code, body: response_body}} ->
        {:error, %{status: status_code, body: response_body}}

      {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{} = error} ->
        {:error, error}
    end
  end
end
b. Service Agent Module Update
Update the ServiceAgent to utilize the LLMClient for processing incoming messages and generating intelligent responses.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/service_agent.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.ServiceAgent do
  use GenServer
  alias ServiceColony.LLMClient
  alias ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint

  # Client API
  def start_link(_opts) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{}, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def send_message(to, subject, content) do
    Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(ServiceColony.PubSub, "process:lobby", %{
      to: to,
      subject: subject,
      content: content
    })
  end

  # Server Callbacks
  def init(state) do
    Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(ServiceColony.PubSub, "process:lobby")
    {:ok, state}
  end

  def handle_info(%{to: to, subject: subject, content: content}, state) do
    # Process message using LLM
    case LLMClient.process_message(content) do
      {:ok, response} ->
        # Broadcast the response back to the intended receiver
        Endpoint.broadcast!("process:lobby", "receive_message", %{
          from: "ServiceAgent",
          to: to,
          subject: "#{subject}_response",
          content: response
        })

      {:error, reason} ->
        IO.puts("LLM processing failed: #{inspect(reason)}")
    end

    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
4. Establish Real-Time Event Loop with Phoenix PubSub
Ensure that all components are subscribed to relevant PubSub topics to enable real-time communication and updates.

a. Subscribe to PubSub in Ash Resources
Modify the Process Ash Resource to publish events upon creation, update, or deletion.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/process.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.Process do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  ash_postgres do
    table "processes"
    repo ServiceColony.Repo
  end

  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key :id

    attribute :name, :string, allow_nil?: false
    attribute :description, :string

    attribute :annotations, {:array, :string}, default: []
    attribute :comments, {:array, :string}, default: []
    attribute :localization, :map, default: %{"language" => "en"}
  end

  relationships do
    has_many :roles, ServiceColony.Role
    has_many :activities, ServiceColony.Activity
    has_many :scenarios, ServiceColony.Scenario
    has_one :data_structures, ServiceColony.DataStructures
  end

  actions do
    defaults [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]

    create :create do
      before do
        {:ok, changeset} = Ash.Resource.publish_event(Process, :create, changeset)
        {:ok, changeset}
      end
    end

    update :update do
      before do
        {:ok, changeset} = Ash.Resource.publish_event(Process, :update, changeset)
        {:ok, changeset}
      end
    end

    destroy :destroy do
      before do
        {:ok, changeset} = Ash.Resource.publish_event(Process, :destroy, changeset)
        {:ok, changeset}
      end
    end
  end
end
b. Publish Events in Ash Resource
Implement event publishing in Ash Resources to communicate with the ProcessService.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/services/process_event_handler.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.Services.ProcessEventHandler do
  use Ash.EventHandler

  alias ServiceColony.Process

  def handle_event(:create, %{record: process}, _opts) do
    Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(ServiceColony.PubSub, "process_updates", {:process_created, process})
    {:ok, []}
  end

  def handle_event(:update, %{record: process}, _opts) do
    Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(ServiceColony.PubSub, "process_updates", {:process_updated, process})
    {:ok, []}
  end

  def handle_event(:destroy, %{record: process}, _opts) do
    Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(ServiceColony.PubSub, "process_updates", {:process_deleted, process.id})
    {:ok, []}
  end
end
c. Register Event Handlers in Ash Resources
Ensure that each Ash Resource registers its event handler.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/process.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.Process do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  ash_postgres do
    table "processes"
    repo ServiceColony.Repo
  end

  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key :id

    attribute :name, :string, allow_nil?: false
    attribute :description, :string

    attribute :annotations, {:array, :string}, default: []
    attribute :comments, {:array, :string}, default: []
    attribute :localization, :map, default: %{"language" => "en"}
  end

  relationships do
    has_many :roles, ServiceColony.Role
    has_many :activities, ServiceColony.Activity
    has_many :scenarios, ServiceColony.Scenario
    has_one :data_structures, ServiceColony.DataStructures
  end

  actions do
    defaults [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]
  end

  events do
    event :create do
      handler ServiceColony.Services.ProcessEventHandler
    end

    event :update do
      handler ServiceColony.Services.ProcessEventHandler
    end

    event :destroy do
      handler ServiceColony.Services.ProcessEventHandler
    end
  end
end
5. Enhance the Nuxt.js Frontend for Real-Time Interaction
Ensure that the frontend can handle real-time updates and provide a seamless user experience.

a. Update Vuex Store for Real-Time Updates
Modify the Vuex store to handle incoming real-time updates from Phoenix Channels.

javascript
Copy code
// store/index.js

export const state = () => ({
  processes: []
})

export const mutations = {
  ADD_PROCESS(state, process) {
    state.processes.push(process)
  },
  UPDATE_PROCESS(state, updatedProcess) {
    const index = state.processes.findIndex(p => p.id === updatedProcess.id)
    if (index !== -1) {
      state.processes.splice(index, 1, updatedProcess)
    }
  },
  DELETE_PROCESS(state, id) {
    state.processes = state.processes.filter(p => p.id !== id)
  }
}

export const actions = {
  sendCreateProcess({ }, processData) {
    this.$channel.push("create_process", processData)
      .receive("ok", resp => {
        console.log("Process created:", resp)
      })
      .receive("error", resp => {
        console.error("Error creating process:", resp)
      })
  },
  sendUpdateProcess({ }, processData) {
    this.$channel.push("update_process", processData)
      .receive("ok", resp => {
        console.log("Process updated:", resp)
      })
      .receive("error", resp => {
        console.error("Error updating process:", resp)
      })
  },
  sendDeleteProcess({ }, processId) {
    this.$channel.push("delete_process", { id: processId })
      .receive("ok", resp => {
        console.log("Process deleted:", resp)
      })
      .receive("error", resp => {
        console.error("Error deleting process:", resp)
      })
  }
}
b. Update Dashboard Component to Handle Real-Time Updates
Ensure the dashboard component reflects real-time changes.

vue
Copy code
<!-- components/Dashboard.vue -->

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Service Colony Dashboard</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Create Process</h2>
      <form @submit.prevent="createProcess">
        <input v-model="newProcess.name" placeholder="Process Name" required />
        <input v-model="newProcess.description" placeholder="Description" />
        <button type="submit">Create</button>
      </form>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Processes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li v-for="process in processes" :key="process.id">
          <strong>{{ process.name }}</strong> - {{ process.description }}
          <button @click="deleteProcess(process.id)">Delete</button>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      newProcess: {
        name: '',
        description: ''
      }
    }
  },
  computed: {
    processes() {
      return this.$store.state.processes
    }
  },
  methods: {
    createProcess() {
      const { name, description } = this.newProcess
      this.$store.dispatch('sendCreateProcess', { name, description })
      this.newProcess.name = ''
      this.newProcess.description = ''
    },
    deleteProcess(id) {
      this.$store.dispatch('sendDeleteProcess', id)
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    // Listen for real-time updates
    this.$channel.on("process_created", payload => {
      this.$store.commit("ADD_PROCESS", payload)
    })

    this.$channel.on("process_updated", payload => {
      this.$store.commit("UPDATE_PROCESS", payload)
    })

    this.$channel.on("process_deleted", payload => {
      this.$store.commit("DELETE_PROCESS", payload.id)
    })
  }
}
</script>
6. Integrate LLMs for Intelligent Recommendations and Automation
Enhance the system's intelligence by allowing LLMs to analyze and provide recommendations based on process data.

a. LLM Integration in Process Service
Modify the ProcessService to utilize LLMs for generating intelligent insights or suggestions when a process is created or updated.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/services/process_service.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.Services.ProcessService do
  use GenServer
  alias ServiceColony.Process
  alias ServiceColonyWeb.Endpoint
  alias ServiceColony.LLMClient

  # Client API
  def start_link(_opts) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{}, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  # Server Callbacks
  def init(state) do
    Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(ServiceColony.PubSub, "process_updates")
    {:ok, state}
  end

  def handle_info({:process_created, process}, state) do
    # Generate intelligent insights using LLM
    prompt = "Provide an overview and potential improvements for the following process:\n\nName: #{process.name}\nDescription: #{process.description}"

    case LLMClient.process_message(prompt) do
      {:ok, insights} ->
        # Broadcast insights back to the frontend
        Endpoint.broadcast!("process:lobby", "process_insights", %{
          process_id: process.id,
          insights: insights
        })

      {:error, reason} ->
        IO.puts("LLM processing failed: #{inspect(reason)}")
    end

    {:noreply, state}
  end

  def handle_info({:process_updated, process}, state) do
    # Generate intelligent insights using LLM
    prompt = "Provide updates and further recommendations for the following process:\n\nName: #{process.name}\nDescription: #{process.description}"

    case LLMClient.process_message(prompt) do
      {:ok, insights} ->
        # Broadcast insights back to the frontend
        Endpoint.broadcast!("process:lobby", "process_insights", %{
          process_id: process.id,
          insights: insights
        })

      {:error, reason} ->
        IO.puts("LLM processing failed: #{inspect(reason)}")
    end

    {:noreply, state}
  end

  def handle_info({:process_deleted, _process_id}, state) do
    # No insights needed for deletion
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
b. Update Frontend to Display Insights
Modify the frontend to display insights received from the backend.

vue
Copy code
<!-- components/Dashboard.vue -->

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Service Colony Dashboard</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Create Process</h2>
      <form @submit.prevent="createProcess">
        <input v-model="newProcess.name" placeholder="Process Name" required />
        <input v-model="newProcess.description" placeholder="Description" />
        <button type="submit">Create</button>
      </form>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Processes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li v-for="process in processes" :key="process.id">
          <strong>{{ process.name }}</strong> - {{ process.description }}
          <button @click="deleteProcess(process.id)">Delete</button>
          <div v-if="process.insights">
            <h4>Insights:</h4>
            <p>{{ process.insights }}</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      newProcess: {
        name: '',
        description: ''
      }
    }
  },
  computed: {
    processes() {
      return this.$store.state.processes
    }
  },
  methods: {
    createProcess() {
      const { name, description } = this.newProcess
      this.$store.dispatch('sendCreateProcess', { name, description })
      this.newProcess.name = ''
      this.newProcess.description = ''
    },
    deleteProcess(id) {
      this.$store.dispatch('sendDeleteProcess', id)
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    // Listen for real-time updates
    this.$channel.on("process_created", payload => {
      this.$store.commit("ADD_PROCESS", { ...payload, insights: null })
    })

    this.$channel.on("process_updated", payload => {
      this.$store.commit("UPDATE_PROCESS", { ...payload, insights: null })
    })

    this.$channel.on("process_deleted", payload => {
      this.$store.commit("DELETE_PROCESS", payload.id)
    })

    // Listen for insights
    this.$channel.on("process_insights", payload => {
      const process = this.processes.find(p => p.id === payload.process_id)
      if (process) {
        this.$set(process, 'insights', payload.insights)
      }
    })
  }
}
</script>
7. Implement the Event Loop and Synchronization
Ensure that all components are synchronized through the event loop, maintaining real-time updates and consistent state across the system.

a. Event-Driven Updates with Phoenix PubSub
Leverage Phoenix PubSub to handle event-driven updates seamlessly across different parts of the application.

Ash Resources publish events to PubSub upon CRUD operations.
Service Modules subscribe to relevant PubSub topics to handle and broadcast updates.
Frontend listens to Phoenix Channels for real-time updates and reflects changes instantly.
b. Handle Edge Cases and Errors
Implement error handling and edge case management to ensure system robustness.

LLM Failures: Log errors and notify administrators if LLM processing fails.
Invalid Inputs: Validate inputs both on the frontend and backend to prevent inconsistent states.
Network Issues: Implement reconnection strategies for Phoenix Channels to handle network disruptions.
8. Finalize and Test the Loop
After integrating all components, perform comprehensive testing to ensure the loop operates as intended.

a. Unit and Integration Tests
Ash Resources: Test CRUD operations and ensure events are published correctly.
Phoenix Channels: Validate message handling and broadcasting.
LLM Integration: Test LLM responses for various inputs.
Frontend: Ensure real-time updates are reflected accurately.
b. Synthetic Logs Example
To illustrate the loop's functionality, here's a synthetic log example demonstrating the interactions between components:

9. Telemetry Integration for Monitoring
Integrate telemetry to monitor the system's performance and health, enabling proactive maintenance and scaling.

a. Add Telemetry Dependencies
Ensure telemetry libraries are included in your project.

elixir
Copy code
# mix.exs

defp deps do
  [
    # ... existing dependencies
    {:telemetry_metrics, "~> 0.6"},
    {:telemetry_poller, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
Run mix deps.get to install.

b. Configure Telemetry Metrics
Set up telemetry metrics to collect and report system performance data.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony_web/telemetry.ex

defmodule ServiceColonyWeb.Telemetry do
  use Supervisor
  import Telemetry.Metrics

  def start_link(arg) do
    Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, arg, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  @impl true
  def init(_arg) do
    children = [
      {Telemetry.Metrics.ConsoleReporter, metrics: metrics()}
    ]

    Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end

  def metrics do
    [
      summary("phoenix.endpoint.stop.duration",
        unit: {:native, :millisecond},
        description: "The time it took to stop a Phoenix endpoint."
      ),
      summary("phoenix.router_dispatch.stop.duration",
        unit: {:native, :millisecond},
        description: "The time it took to dispatch a request."
      ),
      summary("process_service.llm_response_time",
        unit: {:native, :millisecond},
        description: "Time taken by LLM to process messages."
      ),
      counter("process_service.llm_errors",
        description: "Number of errors encountered while processing messages with LLM."
      )
      # Add more metrics as needed
    ]
  end
end
c. Expose Telemetry Data to Frontend
Create API endpoints to fetch telemetry data for the Nuxt.js frontend.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony_web/controllers/telemetry_controller.ex

defmodule ServiceColonyWeb.TelemetryController do
  use ServiceColonyWeb, :controller

  def index(conn, _params) do
    metrics = TelemetryMetrics.get_metrics()
    json(conn, metrics)
  end
end
Implement the TelemetryMetrics module to fetch and format telemetry data.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony/telemetry_metrics.ex

defmodule ServiceColony.TelemetryMetrics do
  def get_metrics do
    # Fetch metrics from telemetry collectors
    # This is a placeholder; implementation depends on your telemetry setup
    %{
      phoenix_endpoint_stop_duration: 120.5,
      phoenix_router_dispatch_stop_duration: 80.3,
      process_service_llm_response_time: 300.2,
      process_service_llm_errors: 2
    }
  end
end
Update the router to include the telemetry endpoint.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/service_colony_web/router.ex

defmodule ServiceColonyWeb.Router do
  use ServiceColonyWeb, :router

  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ["json"]
  end

  scope "/api", ServiceColonyWeb do
    pipe_through :api

    get "/telemetry", TelemetryController, :index
  end

  # ... existing routes
end
d. Display Telemetry in Nuxt.js Frontend
Create a telemetry dashboard component in Nuxt.js to visualize system metrics.

vue
Copy code
<!-- components/TelemetryDashboard.vue -->

<template>
  <div>
    <h2>Telemetry Dashboard</h2>
    <div v-if="telemetry">
      <p><strong>Phoenix Endpoint Stop Duration:</strong> {{ telemetry.phoenix_endpoint_stop_duration }} ms</p>
      <p><strong>Phoenix Router Dispatch Stop Duration:</strong> {{ telemetry.phoenix_router_dispatch_stop_duration }} ms</p>
      <p><strong>LLM Response Time:</strong> {{ telemetry.process_service_llm_response_time }} ms</p>
      <p><strong>LLM Errors:</strong> {{ telemetry.process_service_llm_errors }}</p>
    </div>
    <div v-else>
      <p>Loading telemetry data...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      telemetry: null,
      pollingInterval: null
    }
  },
  async created() {
    await this.fetchTelemetry()
    this.pollingInterval = setInterval(this.fetchTelemetry, 5000) // Poll every 5 seconds
  },
  beforeDestroy() {
    clearInterval(this.pollingInterval)
  },
  methods: {
    async fetchTelemetry() {
      try {
        const response = await this.$axios.$get('/api/telemetry')
        this.telemetry = response
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching telemetry:', error)
      }
    }
  }
}
</script>
Integrate the TelemetryDashboard into your main dashboard component.

10. Finalizing the Loop
With all components in place, the loop functions as follows:

User Interaction:

The user creates, updates, or deletes a process via the Nuxt.js frontend.
Frontend Communication:

The frontend sends corresponding messages (create_process, update_process, delete_process) via Phoenix Channels.
Backend Processing:

Phoenix Channels receive the messages and invoke Ash Resources to perform CRUD operations.
Ash Resources publish events to PubSub upon successful operations.
Service Modules Handling:

ProcessService subscribes to PubSub and listens for process_created, process_updated, and process_deleted events.
Upon receiving events, ProcessService may interact with LLMs to generate insights or perform additional processing.
Real-Time Updates:

ProcessService broadcasts updates and insights back to the process:lobby channel.
The frontend listens for these broadcasts and updates the UI in real-time, reflecting the latest state and insights.
Telemetry Monitoring:

Telemetry data is continuously collected and exposed via API endpoints.
The frontend dashboard displays real-time telemetry metrics, enabling monitoring of system performance.

Thought for 22 seconds

To integrate your Python predict_types function with an Elixir application using Ash and Oban, and to expose this functionality via a Typer-based CLI, you'll need to establish communication between Python and Elixir. This integration allows you to enqueue prediction tasks from the CLI, process them asynchronously in Elixir using Oban, and execute the Python function to perform the actual predictions.

Below is a comprehensive guide to achieving this integration, including code examples and step-by-step instructions.

Overview of the Integration
Elixir Application Setup:

Ash Framework: Manages resources and business logic.
Oban: Handles job processing.
Phoenix Framework: Provides an HTTP API for job submissions.
Python Components:

predict.py: Contains the predict_types function.
Typer CLI: Enables users to submit prediction tasks via the command line.
Communication Flow:

Users submit prediction tasks using the Typer CLI.
The CLI sends HTTP requests to the Phoenix API.
Phoenix enqueues jobs in Oban.
Oban workers execute the Python predict_types function.
Results are processed and can be retrieved or logged as needed.
Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Set Up the Elixir Application with Ash, Oban, and Phoenix
a. Create a New Elixir Project
First, create a new Elixir project with supervision and Phoenix (for the API).

bash
Copy code
mix phx.new ds_pi_code_assistant --no-html --no-webpack --binary-id
cd ds_pi_code_assistant
b. Add Dependencies
Update your mix.exs file to include Ash, Oban, and other necessary dependencies.

elixir
Copy code
defp deps do
  [
    {:phoenix, "~> 1.6.0"},
    {:phoenix_pubsub, "~> 2.0"},
    {:phoenix_ecto, "~> 4.4"},
    {:ecto_sql, "~> 3.6"},
    {:postgrex, ">= 0.0.0"},
    {:ash, "~> 2.0"},
    {:oban, "~> 2.13"},
    {:jason, "~> 1.2"},
    {:plug_cowboy, "~> 2.5"}
    # Add other dependencies as needed
  ]
end
Fetch the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
mix deps.get
c. Configure Oban
In your config/config.exs, configure Oban with your repository.

elixir
Copy code
config :ds_pi_code_assistant, Oban,
  repo: DsPiCodeAssistant.Repo,
  plugins: [Oban.Plugins.Pruner],
  queues: [default: 10]
d. Set Up the Database
Ensure your database configuration is correct in config/dev.exs and other environment-specific config files.

Create and migrate the database, including Oban's migrations.

bash
Copy code
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.gen.migration add_oban_jobs
In the generated migration file (e.g., priv/repo/migrations/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX_add_oban_jobs.exs), add:

elixir
Copy code
defmodule DsPiCodeAssistant.Repo.Migrations.AddObanJobs do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def up do
    Oban.Migrations.up()
  end

  def down do
    Oban.Migrations.down()
  end
end
Run the migrations:

bash
Copy code
mix ecto.migrate
e. Define the Oban Worker
Create an Oban worker that will execute the Python predict_types function.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/ds_pi_code_assistant/workers/predict_worker.ex

defmodule DsPiCodeAssistant.Workers.PredictWorker do
  use Oban.Worker, queue: :default, max_attempts: 5

  alias __MODULE__
  require Logger

  @impl Oban.Worker
  def perform(%Oban.Job{args: args}) do
    tasks = args["tasks"]

    # Encode tasks as JSON
    json_input = Jason.encode!(tasks)

    # Path to the Python script
    python_script_path = Path.expand("predict.py", :code.priv_dir(:ds_pi_code_assistant))

    # Execute the Python script
    {output, exit_code} =
      System.cmd("python3", [python_script_path], input: json_input, stderr_to_stdout: true)

    if exit_code == 0 do
      # Decode the output
      case Jason.decode(output) do
        {:ok, results} ->
          Logger.info("Prediction results: #{inspect(results)}")
          {:ok, results}

        {:error, decode_error} ->
          Logger.error("Failed to decode prediction results: #{decode_error}")
          {:error, "Failed to decode prediction results"}
      end
    else
      Logger.error("Prediction script failed with exit code #{exit_code}: #{output}")
      {:error, "Prediction script failed"}
    end
  end
end
Notes:

The Python script predict.py should be placed in the priv directory of your Elixir project (priv/predict.py).
Ensure the script is executable and has the necessary permissions.
f. Update the Supervision Tree
Ensure that Oban and the worker are started under the supervision tree.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/ds_pi_code_assistant/application.ex

defmodule DsPiCodeAssistant.Application do
  # See https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Application.html
  # for more information on OTP Applications
  @moduledoc false

  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      DsPiCodeAssistant.Repo,
      DsPiCodeAssistantWeb.Telemetry,
      {Phoenix.PubSub, name: DsPiCodeAssistant.PubSub},
      DsPiCodeAssistantWeb.Endpoint,
      {Oban, Application.fetch_env!(:ds_pi_code_assistant, Oban)}
      # Add other workers and supervisors as children
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: DsPiCodeAssistant.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end

  # Tell Phoenix to update the endpoint configuration
  # whenever the application is updated.
  def config_change(changed, _new, removed) do
    DsPiCodeAssistantWeb.Endpoint.config_change(changed, removed)
    :ok
  end
end
2. Implement the Python predict_types Function
Create the Python script that contains the predict_types function. Place this script in the priv directory of your Elixir project (priv/predict.py).

python
Copy code
# priv/predict.py

import sys
import json
import logging
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Define the PredictType model
class PredictType(BaseModel):
    input_data: dict
    output_model: str  # Assuming output_model is a string representing the model name

# Define a BaseModel for prediction results
class PredictionResult(BaseModel):
    result: str  # Adjust fields based on actual prediction output

def predict_type(input_data, output_model):
    """
    Placeholder for the actual prediction logic.
    Replace this with the real implementation.
    """
    logger.info(f"Running prediction with input: {input_data} using model: {output_model}")
    # Simulate a prediction result
    return {"result": f"Prediction based on {output_model}"}

def predict_types(type_pairs: List[PredictType]) -> List[PredictionResult]:
    """
    Runs a list of PredictType tasks concurrently and returns their results.

    Args:
        type_pairs (List[PredictType]): A list of PredictType instances representing individual prediction tasks.

    Returns:
        List[PredictionResult]: A list of prediction results corresponding to each PredictType task.
    """
    results: List[PredictionResult] = []

    for task in type_pairs:
        try:
            logger.debug(f"Starting prediction for task: {task}")
            prediction = predict_type(task.input_data, task.output_model)
            result = PredictionResult(**prediction)
            results.append(result)
            logger.debug(f"Prediction successful: {result}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Prediction failed for task {task}: {e}")
            # Depending on requirements, you might want to append an error result or skip
            continue

    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Read JSON input from stdin
        input_json = sys.stdin.read()
        task_dicts = json.loads(input_json)
        type_pairs = [PredictType(**task) for task in task_dicts]

        # Run predictions
        results = predict_types(type_pairs)

        # Output results as JSON
        print(json.dumps([result.dict() for result in results]))
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to process prediction tasks: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)
Notes:

Ensure you have pydantic installed in your Python environment:

bash
Copy code
pip install pydantic
Adjust the PredictionResult model based on the actual output of your prediction logic.

Replace the predict_type function with your actual prediction implementation.

3. Create the Phoenix API Endpoint
Implement an API endpoint in Phoenix to receive prediction tasks and enqueue them as Oban jobs.

a. Define the Route
In lib/ds_pi_code_assistant_web/router.ex, add the following route:

elixir
Copy code
scope "/api", DsPiCodeAssistantWeb do
  pipe_through :api

  post "/predict", PredictController, :create
end
b. Implement the PredictController
Create lib/ds_pi_code_assistant_web/controllers/predict_controller.ex:

elixir
Copy code
defmodule DsPiCodeAssistantWeb.PredictController do
  use DsPiCodeAssistantWeb, :controller
  alias DsPiCodeAssistant.Workers.PredictWorker
  alias Oban

  def create(conn, %{"tasks" => tasks}) when is_list(tasks) do
    # Enqueue the job with the tasks
    %{
      "tasks" => tasks
    }
    |> PredictWorker.new()
    |> Oban.insert()

    conn
    |> put_status(:accepted)
    |> json(%{status: "Prediction job enqueued"})
  end

  def create(conn, _params) do
    conn
    |> put_status(:bad_request)
    |> json(%{error: "Invalid parameters. 'tasks' must be a list of prediction tasks."})
  end
end
Notes:

The endpoint expects a JSON payload with a tasks key containing a list of prediction tasks.
Each task should include input_data and output_model.
c. Start Phoenix Server
Ensure your Phoenix endpoint is running. Update lib/ds_pi_code_assistant_web/endpoint.ex if necessary.

Start the Phoenix server:

bash
Copy code
mix phx.server
4. Develop the Typer-Based CLI in Python
Create a Python CLI using Typer that allows users to submit prediction tasks to the Phoenix API.

a. Install Typer and Dependencies
Set up a virtual environment and install Typer and requests.

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install typer requests
b. Create the CLI Script
Create a file named cli.py:

python
Copy code
# cli.py

import typer
import requests
from typing import List, Dict
import json

app = typer.Typer()

@app.command()
def submit(
    tasks: str = typer.Argument(
        ..., help="JSON string representing a list of prediction tasks."
    ),
    api_url: str = typer.Option(
        "http://localhost:4000/api/predict", help="API endpoint for submitting prediction tasks."
    )
):
    """
    Submit a list of prediction tasks to the DS-Pi Code Assistant.

    TASKS should be a JSON string representing a list of tasks, each with 'input_data' and 'output_model'.
    Example:
        '[{"input_data": {"key1": "value1"}, "output_model": "ModelA"}, {"input_data": {"key2": "value2"}, "output_model": "ModelB"}]'
    """
    try:
        # Parse the tasks JSON string
        task_list = json.loads(tasks)
        if not isinstance(task_list, list):
            raise ValueError("Tasks must be a list of prediction tasks.")

        # Validate each task
        for task in task_list:
            if not isinstance(task, dict):
                raise ValueError("Each task must be a dictionary.")
            if "input_data" not in task or "output_model" not in task:
                raise ValueError("Each task must contain 'input_data' and 'output_model'.")

        # Send the POST request to the API
        response = requests.post(api_url, json={"tasks": task_list})

        if response.status_code in [200, 202]:
            typer.echo("Prediction job successfully enqueued.")
            typer.echo(f"Response: {response.json()}")
        else:
            typer.echo(
                f"Failed to enqueue prediction job. Status Code: {response.status_code}",
                err=True
            )
            typer.echo(f"Response: {response.text}", err=True)

    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        typer.echo("Invalid JSON format for tasks.", err=True)
    except Exception as e:
        typer.echo(f"Error: {e}", err=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
c. Usage Example
Activate your virtual environment and run the CLI with a sample JSON string.

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
python cli.py submit '[{"input_data": {"key1": "value1"}, "output_model": "ModelA"}, {"input_data": {"key2": "value2"}, "output_model": "ModelB"}]'
Expected Output:

css
Copy code
Prediction job successfully enqueued.
Response: {"status":"Prediction job enqueued"}
5. Connecting It All Together
a. Directory Structure
Ensure your project directory has the following structure:

arduino
Copy code
ds_pi_code_assistant/
├── lib/
│   ├── ds_pi_code_assistant/
│   │   └── workers/
│   │       └── predict_worker.ex
│   └── ds_pi_code_assistant_web/
│       ├── controllers/
│       │   └── predict_controller.ex
│       └── router.ex
├── priv/
│   └── predict.py
├── config/
│   └── config.exs
├── mix.exs
├── cli.py
└── ...
b. Ensure Python Script is Executable
Make sure predict.py has the correct permissions and is executable.

bash
Copy code
chmod +x priv/predict.py
c. Test the Integration
Start the Phoenix Server:

bash
Copy code
mix phx.server
Submit a Prediction Job via CLI:

bash
Copy code
python cli.py submit '[{"input_data": {"user_id": 1, "text": "Sample input"}, "output_model": "ModelA"}]'
Check Logs:

In your Phoenix server terminal, you should see logs indicating that the job was processed, the Python script was executed, and the prediction results were logged.

Example Logs:

csharp
Copy code
[info] Prediction job enqueued
[info] Starting prediction for task: %{"input_data" => %{"user_id" => 1, "text" => "Sample input"}, "output_model" => "ModelA"}
[info] Prediction results: [%{"result" => "Prediction based on ModelA"}]
6. Enhancements and Best Practices
a. Secure the API Endpoint
To prevent unauthorized access to your prediction API, implement authentication mechanisms such as API keys or tokens.

Example: Using API Keys

Add a Plug for API Key Authentication:

elixir
Copy code
# lib/ds_pi_code_assistant_web/plugs/api_key_auth.ex

defmodule DsPiCodeAssistantWeb.Plugs.ApiKeyAuth do
  import Plug.Conn

  @api_key "your_secret_api_key"  # Store securely in environment variables

  def init(default), do: default

  def call(conn, _default) do
    case get_req_header(conn, "authorization") do
      ["Bearer " <> key] when key == @api_key ->
        conn

      _ ->
        conn
        |> send_resp(:unauthorized, "Unauthorized")
        |> halt()
    end
  end
end
Use the Plug in the Pipeline:

elixir
Copy code
# lib/ds_pi_code_assistant_web/router.ex

pipeline :api do
  plug :accepts, ["json"]
  plug DsPiCodeAssistantWeb.Plugs.ApiKeyAuth
end
Update the Typer CLI to Include the API Key:

python
Copy code
# cli.py

import typer
import requests
from typing import List, Dict
import json

app = typer.Typer()

@app.command()
def submit(
    tasks: str = typer.Argument(
        ..., help="JSON string representing a list of prediction tasks."
    ),
    api_url: str = typer.Option(
        "http://localhost:4000/api/predict", help="API endpoint for submitting prediction tasks."
    ),
    api_key: str = typer.Option(
        ..., help="API key for authentication."
    )
):
    """
    Submit a list of prediction tasks to the DS-Pi Code Assistant.

    TASKS should be a JSON string representing a list of tasks, each with 'input_data' and 'output_model'.
    Example:
        '[{"input_data": {"key1": "value1"}, "output_model": "ModelA"}, {"input_data": {"key2": "value2"}, "output_model": "ModelB"}]'
    """
    try:
        # Parse the tasks JSON string
        task_list = json.loads(tasks)
        if not isinstance(task_list, list):
            raise ValueError("Tasks must be a list of prediction tasks.")

        # Validate each task
        for task in task_list:
            if not isinstance(task, dict):
                raise ValueError("Each task must be a dictionary.")
            if "input_data" not in task or "output_model" not in task:
                raise ValueError("Each task must contain 'input_data' and 'output_model'.")

        # Set the Authorization header
        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
        }

        # Send the POST request to the API
        response = requests.post(api_url, json={"tasks": task_list}, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code in [200, 202]:
            typer.echo("Prediction job successfully enqueued.")
            typer.echo(f"Response: {response.json()}")
        else:
            typer.echo(
                f"Failed to enqueue prediction job. Status Code: {response.status_code}",
                err=True
            )
            typer.echo(f"Response: {response.text}", err=True)

    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        typer.echo("Invalid JSON format for tasks.", err=True)
    except Exception as e:
        typer.echo(f"Error: {e}", err=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
Usage Example with API Key:

bash
Copy code
python cli.py submit '[{"input_data": {"user_id": 1, "text": "Sample input"}, "output_model": "ModelA"}]' --api-key your_secret_api_key
b. Handle Asynchronous Responses
Currently, the CLI enqueues jobs and immediately responds. To handle asynchronous results, consider implementing a mechanism to retrieve results, such as:

Polling: Implement endpoints to check job status and retrieve results.
WebSockets: Use Phoenix Channels to push results to the frontend or notify the CLI.
Callbacks: Allow the Python CLI to specify a callback URL where results can be sent.
Example: Implementing Job Status Retrieval

Update the Oban Worker to Store Results:

Modify the PredictWorker to store results in the database or another persistent storage.

elixir
Copy code
# lib/ds_pi_code_assistant/workers/predict_worker.ex

defmodule DsPiCodeAssistant.Workers.PredictWorker do
  use Oban.Worker, queue: :default, max_attempts: 5

  alias DsPiCodeAssistant.Repo
  alias DsPiCodeAssistant.PredictionResult
  require Logger

  @impl Oban.Worker
  def perform(%Oban.Job{args: args, id: job_id}) do
    tasks = args["tasks"]

    # Encode tasks as JSON
    json_input = Jason.encode!(tasks)

    # Path to the Python script
    python_script_path = Path.expand("priv/predict.py", :code.priv_dir(:ds_pi_code_assistant))

    # Execute the Python script
    {output, exit_code} =
      System.cmd("python3", [python_script_path], input: json_input, stderr_to_stdout: true)

    if exit_code == 0 do
      # Decode the output
      case Jason.decode(output) do
        {:ok, results} ->
          # Store the results
          Enum.each(results, fn result ->
            %PredictionResult{}
            |> PredictionResult.changeset(result)
            |> Repo.insert()
          end)

          Logger.info("Prediction results stored successfully.")
          :ok

        {:error, decode_error} ->
          Logger.error("Failed to decode prediction results: #{decode_error}")
          {:error, "Failed to decode prediction results"}
      end
    else
      Logger.error("Prediction script failed with exit code #{exit_code}: #{output}")
      {:error, "Prediction script failed"}
    end
  end
end
Define a Schema for Prediction Results:

Create lib/ds_pi_code_assistant/prediction_result.ex:

elixir
Copy code
defmodule DsPiCodeAssistant.PredictionResult do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset

  schema "prediction_results" do
    field :result, :string
    belongs_to :job, Oban.Job

    timestamps()
  end

  def changeset(prediction_result, attrs) do
    prediction_result
    |> cast(attrs, [:result, :job_id])
    |> validate_required([:result, :job_id])
  end
end
Create Migration for Prediction Results:

bash
Copy code
mix ecto.gen.migration create_prediction_results
In the migration file:

elixir
Copy code
defmodule DsPiCodeAssistant.Repo.Migrations.CreatePredictionResults do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    create table(:prediction_results) do
      add :result, :string, null: false
      add :job_id, references(:oban_jobs, on_delete: :delete_all), null: false

      timestamps()
    end

    create index(:prediction_results, [:job_id])
  end
end
Run the migration:

bash
Copy code
mix ecto.migrate
Update the Oban Worker to Associate Results with Jobs:

elixir
Copy code
# lib/ds_pi_code_assistant/workers/predict_worker.ex

defmodule DsPiCodeAssistant.Workers.PredictWorker do
  use Oban.Worker, queue: :default, max_attempts: 5

  alias DsPiCodeAssistant.{Repo, PredictionResult}
  require Logger

  @impl Oban.Worker
  def perform(%Oban.Job{args: args, id: job_id}) do
    tasks = args["tasks"]

    # Encode tasks as JSON
    json_input = Jason.encode!(tasks)

    # Path to the Python script

  end
end
Expose an Endpoint to Retrieve Prediction Results

Add a new route and controller action to retrieve results based on the job ID.

a. Define the Route
In lib/ds_pi_code_assistant_web/router.ex, add:

elixir
Copy code
scope "/api", DsPiCodeAssistantWeb do
  pipe_through :api

  post "/predict", PredictController, :create
  get "/predict/:job_id/results", PredictController, :results
end
b. Update the PredictController
elixir
Copy code
defmodule DsPiCodeAssistantWeb.PredictController do
  use DsPiCodeAssistantWeb, :controller
  alias DsPiCodeAssistant.Workers.PredictWorker
  alias DsPiCodeAssistant.{PredictionResult, Repo}
  alias Oban.Job

  def create(conn, %{"tasks" => tasks}) when is_list(tasks) do
    # Enqueue the job with the tasks
    job = %{
      "tasks" => tasks
    }
    |> PredictWorker.new()
    |> Oban.insert!()

    conn
    |> put_status(:accepted)
    |> json(%{status: "Prediction job enqueued", job_id: job.id})
  end

  def create(conn, _params) do
    conn
    |> put_status(:bad_request)
    |> json(%{error: "Invalid parameters. 'tasks' must be a list of prediction tasks."})
  end

  def results(conn, %{"job_id" => job_id}) do
    case Repo.get(Job, job_id) do
      nil ->
        conn
        |> put_status(:not_found)
        |> json(%{error: "Job not found."})

      %Job{state: "completed"} ->
        results = Repo.all(from pr in PredictionResult, where: pr.job_id == ^job_id, select: pr.result)
        conn
        |> put_status(:ok)
        |> json(%{job_id: job_id, results: results})

      %Job{state: state} ->
        conn
        |> put_status(:ok)
        |> json(%{job_id: job_id, state: state, results: []})
    end
  end
end
c. Update the Typer CLI to Retrieve Results
Modify cli.py to allow fetching results based on the job ID.

python
Copy code
# cli.py

You said:
review conversation context to find gaps and close loops with LLMs
ChatGPT

Thought for a couple of seconds

Certainly! Let's perform a comprehensive review of the conversation to identify any gaps and suggest enhancements, particularly focusing on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to close the loops within your system. This will ensure a robust, efficient, and intelligent integration between your Python prediction tasks and the Elixir-based Ash Oban Reactor.

1. Review of the Current Integration
Components Involved:
Python Side:

predict_types Function: Processes a list of prediction tasks concurrently.
Typer CLI (cli.py): Allows users to submit prediction tasks and retrieve results via the command line.
Elixir Side:

Phoenix Framework: Provides an HTTP API to receive prediction tasks.
Oban: Handles asynchronous job processing.
Ash Framework: Manages resources and business logic.
Python Script (predict.py): Executes the predict_types function.
Workflow Summary:
User Submission:

Users submit prediction tasks using the Typer CLI.
The CLI sends an HTTP POST request to the Phoenix API with the tasks.
Job Enqueueing:

Phoenix API receives the tasks and enqueues them as Oban jobs.
Job Processing:

Oban workers pick up the jobs and execute the Python predict.py script.
The Python script runs the predict_types function and returns results.
Result Handling:

Results are stored in the database associated with the Oban job.
Users can retrieve results using the Typer CLI by querying the job ID.
2. Identified Gaps and Enhancement Opportunities
**A. Error Handling and Resilience
Current State:

Basic error logging is implemented in both Elixir and Python.
Oban is configured with max_attempts: 5, allowing for retries on failure.
Gaps:

Detailed Error Reporting: Errors in prediction tasks are logged but not communicated back to the user beyond basic messages.
Fallback Mechanisms: No fallback strategies if the Python script fails consistently (e.g., sending alerts or notifications).
Recommendations:

Enhanced Error Responses:

Return detailed error information to the CLI when a job fails after all retries.
Implement a status tracking system where users can query the status and errors of their jobs.
Alerting and Notifications:

Integrate alerting tools (e.g., email notifications, Slack integrations) to notify administrators of persistent failures.
Use tools like Sentry for real-time error monitoring and alerting.
Graceful Degradation:

Implement fallback mechanisms, such as retrying with a different model or defaulting to a simpler prediction method if the primary model fails.
**B. Security Enhancements
Current State:

API endpoints are protected using API keys.
API keys are handled via environment variables and .env files.
Gaps:

Secure Storage of Secrets: Storing API keys directly in .env files can be insecure, especially in production environments.
Rate Limiting: No implementation of rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API endpoints.
Input Validation: Basic input validation is present, but deeper validation could prevent malformed or malicious inputs.
Recommendations:

Secure Secret Management:

Use secret management services like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to store and manage API keys and other sensitive information securely.
Avoid committing .env files to version control. Use tools like dotenv judiciously, ensuring they're excluded via .gitignore.
Implement Rate Limiting:

Use Phoenix's built-in rate limiting or integrate with libraries like Hammer to prevent abuse.
Define sensible rate limits based on expected usage patterns.
Comprehensive Input Validation:

Implement stricter validation for incoming tasks to ensure they meet expected schemas.
Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks or malformed data processing.
**C. Scalability and Performance
Current State:

Oban is configured with max_workers: 10 for the default queue.
Python script executes prediction tasks sequentially within each job.
Gaps:

Throughput Limitations: Processing multiple tasks sequentially within a single job can lead to bottlenecks.
Resource Management: No dynamic scaling based on load or resource utilization.
Monitoring System Performance: Lack of detailed performance metrics to assess and optimize the system.
Recommendations:

Parallel Task Processing:

Modify the Python script to handle tasks in parallel, utilizing multiprocessing or asynchronous programming to increase throughput.
Alternatively, break down each PredictWorker job into smaller jobs, each handling a single prediction task, allowing Oban to process them concurrently.
Dynamic Scaling:

Implement dynamic scaling for Oban workers based on queue length or system load.
Use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes to scale workers horizontally.
Performance Monitoring:

Integrate performance monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to collect and visualize metrics.
Monitor key metrics such as job enqueueing rate, processing time, failure rates, and system resource utilization.
**D. LLM Integration Enhancements
Current State:

The predict_types function is a placeholder that simulates prediction based on a model name.
Basic structure is in place for integrating prediction models.
Gaps:

Advanced LLM Utilization: The current setup does not leverage the full capabilities of LLMs, such as context-aware predictions, fine-tuning, or model updates.
Model Management: No system in place for managing multiple models, versioning, or dynamically selecting models based on task requirements.
Performance Optimization: Potential latency issues if LLMs are called synchronously within prediction tasks.
Recommendations:

Advanced LLM Features:

Context-Aware Predictions: Enhance the predict_type function to utilize context from previous tasks or external data sources.
Fine-Tuning: Implement mechanisms to fine-tune models based on user feedback or new data, improving prediction accuracy over time.
Model Management System:

Develop a model registry to manage multiple LLMs, track their versions, and facilitate dynamic selection based on task parameters.
Integrate with platforms like Hugging Face for model hosting and management.
Asynchronous LLM Calls:

Decouple LLM inference from the main job processing to reduce latency. For instance, use a separate service or microservice to handle LLM predictions.
Implement caching strategies for frequent predictions to minimize redundant LLM calls and improve response times.
Resource Optimization:

Utilize GPU acceleration for LLM inference if applicable, leveraging tools like NVIDIA CUDA or cloud-based GPU services.
Implement batching of prediction tasks to optimize resource utilization and reduce overhead.
**E. User Experience and Feedback Loops
Current State:

Users submit tasks via CLI and retrieve results using job IDs.
Basic success and error messages are provided.
Gaps:

Feedback on Predictions: No mechanism to provide users with insights or feedback on the predictions beyond raw results.
User-Friendly Interfaces: Relying solely on CLI may limit usability for some users.
Continuous Improvement: Lack of systems to gather user feedback for continuous model and system improvements.
Recommendations:

Enhanced Feedback Mechanisms:

Provide detailed explanations or confidence scores for each prediction to help users understand the results better.
Implement features for users to provide feedback on prediction accuracy, enabling iterative model improvements.
User-Friendly Interfaces:

Develop a web-based dashboard or GUI for users to submit tasks, monitor job statuses, and view results more intuitively.
Integrate with messaging platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) to allow task submissions and result notifications directly within these environments.
Continuous Learning and Improvement:

Use collected feedback to retrain and improve LLM models, enhancing prediction accuracy and relevance.
Implement A/B testing for different models or prediction strategies to determine the most effective approaches.
**F. Documentation and Developer Experience
Current State:

Detailed integration steps and code examples are provided.
Basic comments and docstrings are present in the code.
Gaps:

Comprehensive Documentation: Lack of extensive documentation covering all aspects of the system, including setup, usage, troubleshooting, and contribution guidelines.
Developer Tools: Absence of tools to facilitate easier development, testing, and deployment.
Recommendations:

Comprehensive Documentation:

Create a detailed README file outlining the system architecture, setup instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips.
Develop API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman to provide interactive API references.
Developer Tools and Scripts:

Implement scripts for automated testing, deployment, and environment setup to streamline the development workflow.
Use CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to automate testing and deployment processes.
Contribution Guidelines:

Define clear guidelines for contributing to the project, including coding standards, commit message conventions, and branching strategies.
3. Closing the Loops with LLMs
To close the loops within your system using LLMs, consider the following strategies that enhance feedback mechanisms, continuous improvement, and intelligent automation:

**A. Automated Feedback Analysis
Strategy: Leverage LLMs to analyze user feedback and system logs to identify areas for improvement automatically.

Implementation:

Feedback Collection:

Enable users to submit feedback on prediction results via the CLI or web interface.
Collect structured feedback data, including ratings, comments, and suggestions.
Feedback Processing with LLMs:

Use LLMs to parse and analyze feedback, extracting key insights and sentiment.
Automatically categorize feedback to identify common issues or feature requests.
Actionable Insights:

Generate reports or dashboards highlighting areas needing attention.
Trigger model retraining or system adjustments based on aggregated feedback.
**B. Intelligent Task Scheduling and Prioritization
Strategy: Utilize LLMs to optimize the scheduling and prioritization of prediction tasks based on their content, urgency, or resource requirements.

Implementation:

Task Classification:

Use LLMs to classify incoming tasks based on complexity, required resources, or priority levels.
Assign higher priority to critical or time-sensitive tasks.
Dynamic Scheduling:

Adjust Oban's queue priorities dynamically based on task classifications.

Verifying Web Applications: From Business Level
Specifications to Automated Model-Based Testing
Christian Colombo Mark Micallef Mark Scerri
PEST Research Lab

University of Malta, Malta
{christian.colombo | mark.micallef | msce0013}@um.edu.mt
One of reasons preventing a wider uptake of model-based testing in the industry is the difficulty which
is encountered by developers when trying to think in terms of properties rather than linear specifications. A disparity has traditionally been perceived between the language spoken by customers who
specify the system and the language required to construct models of that system. The dynamic nature
of the specifications for commercial systems further aggravates this problem in that models would
need to be rechecked after every specification change. In this paper, we propose an approach for
converting specifications written in the commonly-used quasi-natural language Gherkin into models
for use with a model-based testing tool. We have instantiated this approach using QuickCheck and
demonstrate its applicability via a case study on the eHealth system, the national health portal for
Maltese residents.
1 Introduction
In typical commercial contexts, modern software engineering is characterised by a strong customer focus
and, as a result, fluctuating requirements. The industry has developed ways to adapt to this, most notably
through Agile development processes [5] which have gained substantial popularity over the past decade.
These processes start off by gathering requirements from the customer in the form of case scenarios
and subsequently development is built around these scenarios culminating in their implementation and
demonstration to the customer. This process, better known as behaviour-driven development [3], reorientates the development process so as to ground all work around business level customer specifications.
Once the customer scenarios are implemented, the process tends to take on an iterative form whereby the
customer is again asked to review the specification and possibly introduce further scenarios. To keep the
specification language as simple as possible for non-technical customers, scenarios are typically specified in terms of a quasi-natural language called Gherkin [8]. In order to automate test execution, clauses
from the Gherkin specification are associated with executable code using a technology such as Cucumber
[6]. This executable code effectively turns the specification into an automated acceptance test which is
used to test that the system adheres to the customer’s specifications.
Whilst the automation achieved through the running of Gherkin specifications has significantly shortened the test execution process and made it repeatable, a significant limitation is that the scenarios are
never executed in combination with one another: one would typically expect some classes of problems
to arise through the interactions between a sequence of scenarios rather than within the context of individual scenarios. In this context, we present an approach to combine related scenarios into models which
can be consumed by model-based testing tools. In turn, such tools can be used to explore the model,
generating plausible sequences of scenarios that provide more thorough testing of the system for minimal extra effort. We show how this technique has been instantiated on the QuickCheck testing tool and
applied to Malta’s national health portal web application. This paper makes three main contributions:
C. Colombo, M. Micallef & M. Scerri 15
(i) A technique for automatically generating system models from existing test case scenarios written
in the Gherkin language. These models can be consumed by model-based testing tools in order to generate test cases that extend normal testing and facilitate inter-scenario interaction. (ii) A proof-of-concept
tool which applies the technique presented here to generate models for the QuickCheck test case generation tool. (iii) A case study on Malta’s national health portal which demonstrates that the technique can
be applied to a real-world system.
In order to control scope at this stage of our research, we constrain our work to the context of web
applications. Whilst this is a plausible constraint due to the increased proliferation of web applications,
it does not preclude the technique from being modified and applied to other contexts. The rest of the
paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides the reader with the background required to understand
the work presented in this paper whilst Sections 3 and 4 explain the proposed technique and provides
an overview of the instantiation respectively. This is followed by Section 5 whereby we discuss a case
study designed to demonstrate the applicability of the technique. Finally, Section 6 discusses related
work from the literature and Section 7 features our conclusions and opportunities for future work.
2 Background
Gherkin is currently an industry standard language enabling non-technical customers to express requirements in terms of case scenarios. Ensuring that the developed system adheres to these specifications is
crucial for customer acceptance of the resultant system. By associating executable code to statements
within Gherkin, developers can use tools such as Cucumber to automatically execute test scenarios on
the underlying system. However, to enable the automated manipulation of web applications through a
browser, mimicking the user, one would need a tool such as Selenium which provides the necessary
interface to access a web application programmatically. The rest of this section provides the necessary
detail on these technologies so as to enable the reader to understand the work presented here.
2.1 Gherkin
Gherkin [8] is a business readable, domain-specific language which lets users describe what a software
system should do without specifying how it should do it. The language forms an integral part of Behaviour Driven Development [3], a development process which aims to make specification a ubiquitous
language throughout a system’s life cycle. Gherkin specifications take on a so-called Given-When-Then
format as illustrated in Example 1 and the underlying concept is that a business user can specify what is
expected from a system using a series of concrete scenarios. Given some precondition, When the user
does something specific, Then some postcondition should materialise.
Example 1
1. Feature: Doctor’s landing page
2. Scenario: Navigate to lab results page
3. Given I am on the doctors landing page
4. When I click on laboratory results
5. Then I should go to the lab results page
6. Scenario: Navigate back to Doctor’s landing page
7. Given I am on the lab results page
8. When I click on the myHealth logo
9. Then I should go to the doctors landing page
In this example, the client has specified two requirement scenarios as part of a feature on an eHealth system: one dealing with
the process of a doctor viewing the laboratory results and another one of a doctor navigating back to the landing page.
16 Verifying Web Applications
Developers then decompose each scenario into a number of development tasks and the work proceeds
with all activity being a direct result of a particular customer-specified scenario. Furthermore, although
the scenarios are written in a subset of natural language, technologies exist (e.g. Cucumber [6] and
Specflow [14]) which enable developers to implement automated user acceptance tests for every step
in a scenario. That is to say that (i) the user specification becomes executable as an automated test
by the end of a development iteration; and (ii) any future scenarios which include a predefined step
will automatically reuse test automation code, thus in effect building up a domain specific language for
automated testing.
2.2 Cucumber
Cucumber [6] is a technology that enables developers to provide glue code which turns natural language
specifications into executable automated tests. Although originally written in Ruby, the tool has been
ported to a number of languages. It reads plain language text files called feature files (as in Example 1),
extracts scenarios and executes each scenario against the system under test. This is achieved by means of
so-called step definitions, a series of methods which are executed when a step in a feature file matches a
particular pattern. For example for the statement When I click on the myHealth logo, the developer associates code which actually simulates a user clicking on the logo. Once all Gherkin statements
have associated code which can be executed by Cucumber, the latter will iterate through each step, find
a matching step definition and execute the method associated with it. Step definitions can implement
any feature supported by the underlying language. In our case, we are interested in manipulating web
browsers for automated web application testing; something which can be achieved by Selenium.

Introduction
Model-based testing (MBT) has emerged as a powerful methodology for enhancing the verification and validation of software systems. By leveraging formal models to generate test cases, MBT can improve test coverage, reduce redundancy, and adapt to evolving requirements. Despite its advantages, the adoption of MBT in industry has been hindered by several factors, including the complexity of model creation, the disconnect between technical specifications and business-level requirements, and the challenges posed by dynamic system specifications [1].

One significant barrier is the difficulty developers face in transitioning from linear, customer-centric specifications to abstract, model-based representations required for MBT. Traditional specifications, often written in natural language formats like Gherkin [8], are intuitive for non-technical stakeholders but lack the formal structure necessary for automated testing tools such as QuickCheck [2]. Additionally, the dynamic nature of commercial systems, which frequently undergo specification changes, exacerbates the challenge of maintaining accurate and up-to-date models.

To address these challenges, we propose PLAN Pro, an architectural framework designed to integrate Agile Protocol Specifications (APS) with MBT within service colony architectures. PLAN Pro facilitates the automatic conversion of Gherkin-based specifications into machine-readable models, enabling comprehensive inter-scenario testing and leveraging telemetry for real-time system monitoring and adaptation. This integration not only bridges the gap between business-level requirements and technical testing but also enhances the scalability and adaptability of testing processes in dynamic environments.

This paper presents the following contributions:

PLAN Pro Framework: A detailed description of PLAN Pro, illustrating how it integrates APS with MBT within service colony architectures.
Automated Specification Conversion: A methodology for transforming Gherkin-based specifications into QuickCheck-compatible models, enabling automated inter-scenario testing.
Telemetry Integration: An approach for incorporating telemetry data into the testing framework, allowing for real-time monitoring and system adaptation.
Case Study: An application of PLAN Pro to Malta’s national health portal, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing test coverage and system reliability.
Addressing Common Misconceptions: Clarification of prevalent misunderstandings regarding APS and PLAN Pro to foster better comprehension and adoption.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in MBT, APS, and service colony architectures. Section 3 introduces the PLAN Pro framework and its components. Section 4 details the automated specification conversion process. Section 5 discusses the integration of telemetry data. Section 6 presents the case study on Malta’s national health portal. Section 7 addresses common misconceptions, and Section 8 concludes the paper with future work directions.

Related Work
Model-based testing has been extensively studied and applied across various domains to improve software quality [3]. Traditional MBT approaches involve creating formal models that represent the desired behavior of the system under test (SUT). These models are then used to generate test cases automatically [4]. Tools like QuickCheck [2] have popularized property-based testing, allowing developers to specify properties that their code should satisfy, with the tool generating test cases to validate these properties.

Agile methodologies, particularly Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) [3], emphasize close collaboration between developers and non-technical stakeholders. BDD employs natural language specifications, often written in Gherkin [8], to define system behaviors in terms of Given-When-Then scenarios. While BDD enhances communication and ensures alignment with business requirements, it presents challenges when integrating with MBT tools that require formal models.

Service colony architectures, which structure systems as a collection of interacting agents, have gained traction for their scalability and resilience [5]. Integrating MBT within such architectures necessitates efficient communication protocols and robust monitoring mechanisms to handle the dynamic interactions between agents.

Existing literature highlights the gap between natural language specifications and formal models required for MBT. Efforts to bridge this gap include tools that translate Gherkin scenarios into formal representations, yet these solutions often lack automation and fail to accommodate the evolving nature of commercial specifications [6]. Additionally, the integration of telemetry data into testing frameworks remains underexplored, despite its potential to enhance system monitoring and adaptive testing.

PLAN Pro addresses these gaps by providing a structured approach to convert Gherkin-based specifications into machine-readable models suitable for MBT tools like QuickCheck. Furthermore, by incorporating telemetry data into the testing process, PLAN Pro enables real-time monitoring and system adaptation, ensuring that testing remains robust in the face of dynamic system changes.

PLAN Pro Framework
Overview
PLAN Pro is an architectural framework designed to integrate Agile Protocol Specifications (APS) with model-based testing within service colony architectures. It automates the conversion of Gherkin-based specifications into formal models compatible with MBT tools and incorporates telemetry data to facilitate real-time monitoring and system adaptation. The framework comprises the following key components:

Agile Protocol Specification (APS): Defines machine-readable specifications that outline agent roles, communications, and telemetry data structures within the service colony.
Specification Converter: Transforms Gherkin-based scenarios into QuickCheck-compatible models, enabling automated inter-scenario testing.
Telemetry Integration Module: Collects, processes, and utilizes telemetry data to monitor system performance and trigger adaptive responses.
Service Colony Agents: A collection of agents (e.g., Service Agents, Telemetry Agents, Monitor Agents) that interact based on APS-defined protocols and contribute to system functionality and monitoring.
Model-Based Testing Engine: Utilizes QuickCheck to generate and execute test cases derived from the converted specifications, ensuring comprehensive system validation.

Components Detail
Agile Protocol Specification (APS)
APS is a YAML-based specification language that defines the roles of agents, communication protocols, and telemetry data structures within the service colony. By formalizing these aspects, APS ensures that agent interactions are consistent, machine-readable, and conducive to automated testing.

Specification Converter
The Specification Converter automates the transformation of Gherkin-based specifications into QuickCheck-compatible models. It parses Gherkin scenarios, extracts relevant information, and generates formal properties that QuickCheck can use to generate and execute test cases. This automation bridges the gap between business-level specifications and technical testing requirements.

Telemetry Integration Module
This module is responsible for collecting telemetry data from various agents, processing the data to extract meaningful metrics and events, and integrating this information into the testing framework. By leveraging telemetry, the system can monitor performance in real-time, identify anomalies, and trigger adaptive testing processes to maintain system reliability.

Service Colony Agents
Service Colony consists of various agents, each with defined roles and responsibilities as specified by APS. Key agents include:

Service Agents: Perform dedicated functionalities and interact with other agents.
Telemetry Agents: Collect and process telemetry data from Service Agents.
Monitor Agents: Analyze telemetry data, detect anomalies, and trigger system adaptations.
Model-Based Testing Engine
Utilizing QuickCheck, the MBT Engine generates test cases based on the formal models produced by the Specification Converter. These test cases are designed to explore different scenarios, including inter-scenario interactions, ensuring thorough validation of the system against its specifications.

Automated Specification Conversion
Motivation
Gherkin-based specifications, while accessible to non-technical stakeholders, lack the formal structure required for automated model-based testing. Manual conversion of these specifications into formal models is error-prone and time-consuming, especially in dynamic environments where specifications frequently change. Automating this conversion process is essential to maintain consistency, reduce manual effort, and ensure that testing remains aligned with business requirements.

Conversion Process
The Specification Converter within PLAN Pro follows a structured process to transform Gherkin scenarios into QuickCheck-compatible models:

Parsing Gherkin Specifications:

Utilize a YAML parser to read Gherkin-based APS documents.
Extract features, scenarios, and step definitions from the specifications.
Mapping Steps to Properties:

Analyze each Given-When-Then step to identify preconditions, actions, and expected outcomes.
Translate these steps into formal properties that QuickCheck can interpret.
Generating QuickCheck Models:

For each scenario, create a corresponding QuickCheck property that encapsulates the desired behavior.
Define state transitions and interactions between different scenarios to enable inter-scenario testing.
Handling Dynamic Specifications:

Implement versioning mechanisms to track changes in specifications.
Automatically update QuickCheck models upon detecting modifications in Gherkin scenarios.
Example Conversion
Gherkin Scenario:

gherkin
Copy code
Feature: Doctor’s landing page

Scenario: Navigate to lab results page
  Given I am on the doctor's landing page
  When I click on laboratory results
  Then I should go to the lab results page

Scenario: Navigate back to Doctor’s landing page
  Given I am on the lab results page
  When I click on the myHealth logo
  Then I should go to the doctor's landing page
Converted QuickCheck Model:

haskell
Copy code
-- QuickCheck property for navigating to lab results page
prop_navigateToLabResults :: State -> Property
prop_navigateToLabResults state =
  state == LandingPage ==> 
    navigate "laboratory results" == LabResultsPage

-- QuickCheck property for navigating back to landing page
prop_navigateBack :: State -> Property
prop_navigateBack state =
  state == LabResultsPage ==> 
    navigate "myHealth logo" == LandingPage
Explanation:

Each scenario is converted into a QuickCheck property that defines the expected state transitions.
Preconditions (Given) and actions (When) are mapped to conditions and function calls (navigate) in QuickCheck.
Expected outcomes (Then) define the expected state after the action.
Implementation Considerations
Scalability: Ensure that the converter can handle large sets of Gherkin scenarios efficiently.
Extensibility: Design the converter to accommodate additional Gherkin features and custom step definitions.
Error Handling: Implement robust error detection and reporting mechanisms to handle malformed specifications gracefully.
Integration with Version Control: Link the converter with version control systems to track changes and manage model updates effectively.
Telemetry Integration
Importance of Telemetry in MBT
Telemetry plays a crucial role in modern software systems by providing real-time insights into system performance, resource utilization, and user interactions. Integrating telemetry data into the MBT framework enhances the ability to monitor system health, detect anomalies, and adapt testing strategies dynamically. This integration ensures that testing remains relevant and effective in the face of evolving system behaviors and external factors.

Telemetry Data Structures
Telemetry data is structured to capture essential metrics and events that reflect the system's operational state. The following data structures are defined within the APS documents to standardize telemetry data collection:

Metrics
CPU Usage: Percentage of CPU resources used by Service Agents.
Memory Usage: Amount of memory (in MB) used by Service Agents.
Response Time: Average response time (in ms) of Service Agents.
Events
High CPU Usage: Triggered when CPU usage exceeds 80%.
Memory Leak Detected: Triggered when memory usage consistently increases over time.
Slow Response Time: Triggered when response time exceeds 500 ms.
Telemetry Collection and Processing
Service Agents
Service Agents periodically collect telemetry data during their operations. The collect_telemetry method gathers metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and response time. This data is then sent to the Telemetry Agent for processing.

python
Copy code
# service_agent.py (Excerpt)

def collect_telemetry(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:

        "memory_usage": self.get_memory_usage(),
        "response_time": self.get_response_time()
    }
    return telemetry_data
Telemetry Agent

Monitor Agent
The Monitor Agent analyzes incoming telemetry data against defined thresholds to detect anomalies. Upon identifying an event, it triggers system adaptations by communicating with Service Agents.

python
Copy code
# monitor_agent.py (Excerpt)

def analyze_telemetry(self, telemetry: Dict[str, Any]):
    alerts = []
    if telemetry["cpu_usage"] > self.thresholds["cpu_usage"]:
        alerts.append(f"High CPU Usage: {telemetry['cpu_usage']}%")
    if telemetry["memory_usage"] > self.thresholds["memory_usage"]:
        alerts.append(f"High Memory Usage: {telemetry['memory_usage']}MB")
    if telemetry["response_time"] > self.thresholds["response_time"]:
        alerts.append(f"Slow Response Time: {telemetry['response_time']}ms")

    for alert in alerts:
        self.trigger_adaptation(alert)
Triggering Adaptations
When the Monitor Agent detects an anomaly, it sends adaptation requests to Service Agents to perform actions such as scaling up resources or optimizing performance.

python
Copy code
# monitor_agent.py (Excerpt)

def trigger_adaptation(self, alert: str):
    print(f"[{self.name}] Triggering adaptation due to: {alert}")
    adaptation_message = {
        "alert": alert,
        "action": "scale_up"
    }
    self.send_message(receiver="ServiceAgent", subject="Adaptation Request", content=adaptation_message)
Case Study: Malta’s National Health Portal
Overview
To validate the effectiveness of PLAN Pro, we applied the framework to Malta’s national health portal—a critical web application serving Maltese residents. The portal manages sensitive health data, schedules appointments, and provides access to medical records. Ensuring its reliability and performance is paramount.

Objectives
Automate Test Case Generation: Convert existing Gherkin-based specifications into QuickCheck models for automated MBT.
Enhance Test Coverage: Include inter-scenario interactions to identify potential issues arising from sequential operations.
Integrate Telemetry: Monitor system performance in real-time and adapt testing strategies based on telemetry insights.
Implementation
Specification Conversion
We began by converting the portal’s Gherkin specifications into QuickCheck models using the Specification Converter. This process involved parsing the Given-When-Then scenarios and mapping them to formal properties that QuickCheck could utilize to generate and execute test cases.

Example Conversion:

Gherkin Scenario:

gherkin
Copy code
Feature: Appointment Scheduling

Scenario: Schedule a new appointment
  Given I am logged into the health portal
  When I navigate to the appointment scheduling page
  And I enter valid appointment details
  And I submit the appointment request
  Then I should see a confirmation message
  And the appointment should appear in my schedule
QuickCheck Model:

haskell
Copy code
-- QuickCheck property for scheduling a new appointment
prop_scheduleAppointment :: State -> Property
prop_scheduleAppointment state =
  isLoggedIn state == True ==> 
    navigateTo "appointment scheduling page" == AppointmentSchedulingPage
    .&&. enterDetails validDetails == ValidDetailsEntered
    .&&. submitRequest == ConfirmationMessage
    .&&. appointmentExistsInSchedule
Telemetry Integration
Telemetry agents were deployed to monitor key metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and response times. These metrics were continuously collected and analyzed by the Telemetry and Monitor Agents to detect anomalies and trigger necessary adaptations.

Example Telemetry Data:

json
Copy code
{
  "timestamp": "2024-04-25T14:23:05Z",
  "agent_name": "ServiceAgent",
  "state": "OPERATING",
  "cpu_usage": 75.5,
  "memory_usage": 1500.0,
  "response_time": 350.0
}
Adaptation Triggers
During testing, the Monitor Agent detected a spike in response times exceeding the 500 ms threshold during peak usage hours. It triggered an adaptation request to the Service Agents to optimize resource allocation, resulting in reduced response times and improved system performance.

Results
Increased Test Coverage: Automated generation of inter-scenario test cases uncovered previously undetected issues related to sequential operations.
Improved System Reliability: Real-time telemetry monitoring enabled proactive detection and resolution of performance bottlenecks.
Enhanced Adaptability: The system adapted to high-load conditions dynamically, maintaining optimal performance without manual intervention.
Addressing Common Misconceptions
In the initial phases of integrating PLAN Pro and APS within service colony architectures, several misconceptions may arise. Addressing these ensures a clear understanding and effective implementation of the framework.

APS is Exclusive to Agile Methodologies:

Clarification: While APS aligns with Agile principles, it is versatile and can be integrated with various development methodologies that emphasize flexibility and iterative progress.
PLAN Pro is a Proprietary Tool:

Clarification: PLAN Pro is an architectural framework designed to enhance service colony agent communications and does not refer to a specific proprietary software application.
APS Requires Specific Programming Languages:

Clarification: APS is language-agnostic and can be integrated with multiple programming languages and platforms based on implementation needs.
APS and PLAN Pro are Interchangeable:

Clarification: APS serves as a specification language within the PLAN Pro framework. They are complementary components rather than interchangeable concepts.
APS is Only Suitable for Small-Scale Systems:

Clarification: APS is scalable and applicable to both small and large, complex systems, facilitating robust agent communications and telemetry integration.
APS Documents are Intuitively Understandable Without Training:

Clarification: While APS enhances machine readability, creating and maintaining APS documents requires a clear understanding of both the domain and the specification language.
PLAN Pro Focuses Solely on Telemetry:

Clarification: PLAN Pro encompasses defining agent roles, communication protocols, and system adaptations based on telemetry, providing a comprehensive architectural approach.
APS Cannot Handle Dynamic Changes in Specifications:

Clarification: APS is designed to be flexible, allowing for updates and modifications to specifications as system requirements evolve.
Implementing APS and PLAN Pro Requires Extensive Overhauls:

Clarification: APS and PLAN Pro can be incrementally integrated into existing architectures, allowing for gradual enhancements without significant disruptions.
APS and PLAN Pro are Only Applicable to Web Applications:

Clarification: Although demonstrated within a web application context, APS and PLAN Pro are versatile and can be applied to various types of systems, including desktop applications, IoT devices, and distributed services.
Conclusion
The integration of PLAN Pro with Agile Protocol Specifications (APS) offers a robust framework for bridging the gap between business-level specifications and model-based testing within service colony architectures. By automating the conversion of Gherkin-based specifications into QuickCheck-compatible models, PLAN Pro enhances test coverage and ensures that inter-scenario interactions are thoroughly validated. Additionally, the incorporation of telemetry data facilitates real-time monitoring and adaptive testing, ensuring system reliability in dynamic environments.

The case study on Malta’s national health portal demonstrates the practical applicability of PLAN Pro, showcasing significant improvements in test coverage and system adaptability. Addressing common misconceptions surrounding APS and PLAN Pro further clarifies their roles and capabilities, fostering better understanding and adoption in the industry.

Future work will explore extending PLAN Pro to support a wider range of testing tools and environments, enhancing the Specification Converter for greater flexibility, and integrating advanced telemetry analytics to further optimize system performance and testing strategies.

REPLY USING APS YAML ONLY 


Breaking down action items

I’m thinking through the user’s request to review and refine an action item list, distinguishing tasks for ChatGPT and the user, and adding more granular tasks.

Piecing together an APS YAML document

I'm thinking through how to transform the action items list into an APS YAML document, detailing processes, tasks, and roles with feedback loops and code assistant links.

Weighing the tasks

I’m breaking down tasks into roles, separating them for clarity. This ensures each party's responsibilities are clearly defined and organized.

Outlining roles and activities

I’m mapping out an APS YAML to define the roles of Assistant and User, and specifying tasks like drafting papers, providing guides, reviewing content, generating code, and optimizing code.

Mapping out tasks

I’m preparing to create an APS YAML file to translate action items into a structured format, considering tasks like enhancing code drafts based on feedback.

Clarifying roles

I’m detailing the assistant's documentation, code assistance, planning, strategy, educational support, security, compliance, monitoring, maintenance, feedback, iteration, academic, and research responsibilities. The user's tasks span implementation, deployment, project management, security, monitoring, and feedback.
