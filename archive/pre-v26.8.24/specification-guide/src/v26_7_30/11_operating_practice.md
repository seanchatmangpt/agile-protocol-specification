# Operating Practice and Failure Discipline

Adoption begins with one closed claim–falsifier–evidence loop. Teams expand only after that loop is observable and replayable. This part catalogues the failure modes that make high-volume generation look productive while hiding missing standing.

## Guidelines for Creating and Managing APS Documents

Provides practical operating guidance for teams adopting APS.

### Start with one claim loop

**Requirement APS-11-01.** The implementation SHALL represent **start with one claim loop** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.

**Operational test.** A verifier MUST be able to locate the representation, resolve its dependencies, and produce one of the canonical standing outcomes. Missing representation yields `START_WITH_ONE_CLAIM_LOOP_MISSING`; an unavailable checking capability yields `UNSUPPORTED`; contradictory evidence yields a typed refusal rather than a softened success.

**Falsifier.** Conformance is refuted when a same-coordinate candidate can omit or contradict start with one claim loop while still receiving the standing or lifecycle promotion that the concern was intended to guard.

### Keep claims bounded

**Requirement APS-11-02.** The implementation SHALL represent **keep claims bounded** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.

**Operational test.** A verifier MUST be able to locate the representation, resolve its dependencies, and produce one of the canonical standing outcomes. Missing representation yields `KEEP_CLAIMS_BOUNDED_MISSING`; an unavailable checking capability yields `UNSUPPORTED`; contradictory evidence yields a typed refusal rather than a softened success.

**Falsifier.** Conformance is refuted when a same-coordinate candidate can omit or contradict keep claims bounded while still receiving the standing or lifecycle promotion that the concern was intended to guard.

### Separate implementation and verification

**Requirement APS-11-03.** The implementation SHALL represent **separate implementation and verification** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.

**Operational test.** A verifier MUST be able to locate the representation, resolve its dependencies, and produce one of the canonical standing outcomes. Missing representation yields `SEPARATE_IMPLEMENTATION_AND_VERIFICATION_MISSING`; an unavailable checking capability yields `UNSUPPORTED`; contradictory evidence yields a typed refusal rather than a softened success.

**Falsifier.** Conformance is refuted when a same-coordinate candidate can omit or contradict separate implementation and verification while still receiving the standing or lifecycle promotion that the concern was intended to guard.

### Prefer typed refusals

**Requirement APS-11-04.** The implementation SHALL represent **prefer typed refusals** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.

**Operational test.** A verifier MUST be able to locate the representation, resolve its dependencies, and produce one of the canonical standing outcomes. Missing representation yields `PREFER_TYPED_REFUSALS_MISSING`; an unavailable checking capability yields `UNSUPPORTED`; contradictory evidence yields a typed refusal rather than a softened success.

**Falsifier.** Conformance is refuted when a same-coordinate candidate can omit or contradict prefer typed refusals while still receiving the standing or lifecycle promotion that the concern was intended to guard.

### Make nonclaims visible

**Requirement APS-11-05.** The implementation SHALL represent **make nonclaims visible** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.

**Operational test.** A verifier MUST be able to locate the representation, resolve its dependencies, and produce one of the canonical standing outcomes. Missing representation yields `MAKE_NONCLAIMS_VISIBLE_MISSING`; an unavailable checking capability yields `UNSUPPORTED`; contradictory evidence yields a typed refusal rather than a softened success.

**Falsifier.** Conformance is refuted when a same-coordinate candidate can omit or contradict make nonclaims visible while still receiving the standing or lifecycle promotion that the concern was intended to guard.

### Chapter-level minimum conformance

A conforming implementation of this section SHALL make every listed concern machine-readable, SHALL bind evidence to the exact subject coordinate, SHALL preserve the accepted baseline on refusal, and SHALL emit a receipt for successful promotion. The standing ceiling is **PARTIAL_ALIVE | ALIVE | BLOCKED | BUILD_BROKEN | UNKNOWN | UNSUPPORTED**; no chapter text authorizes a stronger claim than observed evidence.

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls in APS Implementation

Catalogs recurring APS failure modes and their corrections.

### Documentation theater

**Requirement APS-11-06.** The implementation SHALL represent **documentation theater** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.

**Operational test.** A verifier MUST be able to locate the representation, resolve its dependencies, and produce one of the canonical standing outcomes. Missing representation yields `DOCUMENTATION_THEATER_MISSING`; an unavailable checking capability yields `UNSUPPORTED`; contradictory evidence yields a typed refusal rather than a softened success.

**Falsifier.** Conformance is refuted when a same-coordinate candidate can omit or contradict documentation theater while still receiving the standing or lifecycle promotion that the concern was intended to guard.

### Overstated evidence

**Requirement APS-11-07.** The implementation SHALL represent **overstated evidence** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.

**Operational test.** A verifier MUST be able to locate the representation, resolve its dependencies, and produce one of the canonical standing outcomes. Missing representation yields `OVERSTATED_EVIDENCE_MISSING`; an unavailable checking capability yields `UNSUPPORTED`; contradictory evidence yields a typed refusal rather than a softened success.

**Falsifier.** Conformance is refuted when a same-coordinate candidate can omit or contradict overstated evidence while still receiving the standing or lifecycle promotion that the concern was intended to guard.

### Self-certification

**Requirement APS-11-08.** The implementation SHALL represent **self-certification** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.

**Operational test.** A verifier MUST be able to locate the representation, resolve its dependencies, and produce one of the canonical standing outcomes. Missing representation yields `SELF_CERTIFICATION_MISSING`; an unavailable checking capability yields `UNSUPPORTED`; contradictory evidence yields a typed refusal rather than a softened success.

**Falsifier.** Conformance is refuted when a same-coordinate candidate can omit or contradict self-certification while still receiving the standing or lifecycle promotion that the concern was intended to guard.

### Configuration drift

**Requirement APS-11-09.** The implementation SHALL represent **configuration drift** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.

**Operational test.** A verifier MUST be able to locate the representation, resolve its dependencies, and produce one of the canonical standing outcomes. Missing representation yields `CONFIGURATION_DRIFT_MISSING`; an unavailable checking capability yields `UNSUPPORTED`; contradictory evidence yields a typed refusal rather than a softened success.

**Falsifier.** Conformance is refuted when a same-coordinate candidate can omit or contradict configuration drift while still receiving the standing or lifecycle promotion that the concern was intended to guard.

### Generated-source editing

**Requirement APS-11-10.** The implementation SHALL represent **generated-source editing** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.
