# Change Log and Standards Map

This part records the v26.7.30 semantic break from the hollow repository scaffold and maps APS to external standards by concern. The mappings are deliberately non-equivalent: PROV-O can express provenance, SHACL can validate graph constraints, and BPMN can depict process flow, but none individually supplies the APS standing calculus.

## Formal lens

```text
mapping(APS, standard) is concern-preserving, not equivalence-preserving
```

## Record of Updates and Changes to the APS

This section defines and initializes the standard change log.

### Change classes

**Requirement APS-14-01.** The implementation SHALL represent **change classes** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.

**Operational test.** A verifier MUST be able to locate the representation, resolve its dependencies, and produce one of the canonical standing outcomes. Missing representation yields `CHANGE_CLASSES_MISSING`; an unavailable checking capability yields `UNSUPPORTED`; contradictory evidence yields a typed refusal rather than a softened success.

**Falsifier.** Conformance is refuted when a same-coordinate candidate can omit or contradict change classes while still receiving the standing or lifecycle promotion that the concern was intended to guard.

### Approval requirements

**Requirement APS-14-02.** The implementation SHALL represent **approval requirements** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.

**Operational test.** A verifier MUST be able to locate the representation, resolve its dependencies, and produce one of the canonical standing outcomes. Missing representation yields `APPROVAL_REQUIREMENTS_MISSING`; an unavailable checking capability yields `UNSUPPORTED`; contradictory evidence yields a typed refusal rather than a softened success.

**Falsifier.** Conformance is refuted when a same-coordinate candidate can omit or contradict approval requirements while still receiving the standing or lifecycle promotion that the concern was intended to guard.

### Migration notes

**Requirement APS-14-03.** The implementation SHALL represent **migration notes** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence. It SHALL NOT leave the concern solely in narrative convention or infer it from a tracker status.

**Operational test.** A verifier MUST be able to locate the representation, resolve its dependencies, and produce one of the canonical standing outcomes. Missing representation yields `MIGRATION_NOTES_MISSING`; an unavailable checking capability yields `UNSUPPORTED`; contradictory evidence yields a typed refusal rather than a softened success.

### Prior 30.1.1 manuscript baseline

**Requirement APS-14-04.** The implementation SHALL represent **prior 30.1.1 manuscript baseline** as an explicit protocol concern with a stable identifier, authority source, evidence expectation, and failure consequence.

### Chapter-level minimum conformance

A conforming implementation of this section SHALL make every listed concern machine-readable, SHALL bind evidence to the exact subject coordinate, SHALL preserve the accepted baseline on refusal, and SHALL emit a receipt for successful promotion. The standing ceiling is **PARTIAL_ALIVE | ALIVE | BLOCKED | BUILD_BROKEN | UNKNOWN | UNSUPPORTED**; no chapter text authorizes a stronger claim than observed evidence.
