# Metadata Annotation Standards Context

The **Metadata Annotation Standards** within the **Agile Protocol Specification (APS)** provide a structured approach for embedding metadata into all documents. These standards ensure consistency, clarity, and machine-readability across the APS framework, enabling effective collaboration between human and AI contributors.

## Purpose

Metadata annotations serve several critical functions:

1. **Identification**: Clearly identify each document's purpose, state, version, author, and related elements at a glance.
2. **Traceability**: Maintain a detailed record of changes, authorship, and document history, supporting governance and compliance.
3. **Machine Readability**: Enable AI tools and automation scripts to parse, interpret, and utilize metadata effectively, promoting seamless integration across the APS framework.
4. **Consistency**: Provide a uniform approach to metadata management, ensuring that all documents adhere to the same standards.

## Key Components of Metadata Annotations

### 1. **Metadata Headers**

- Each document must begin with a metadata header in **YAML** or **JSON** format.
- The metadata header should be placed at the very top of the document to ensure it is immediately accessible and readable by both humans and AI tools.

### 2. **Required Metadata Fields**

- **Title**: A concise, descriptive title of the document.
- **Version**: The current version of the document, following the versioning strategy defined in APS.
- **State**: The current lifecycle state of the document (e.g., Draft, InReview, Provisional, Accepted, Final).
- **Author**: The name(s) or initials of the document author(s).
- **Date Created**: The date when the document was first created.
- **Last Modified**: The date when the document was last updated.
- **Related Documents**: Links or references to other relevant documents within APS.
- **Summary**: A brief overview of the document's content and purpose.
- **Adversarial Role**: Specifies the role of AI or adversarial techniques applied in creating or reviewing the document (e.g., APM for Adversarial Product Management, AT for Adversarial Testing).

### 3. **Supported Formats**

- **YAML**: Used for human readability and easy editing; preferred for most documents.
- **JSON**: Used for machine parsing and integration with automation tools.

### 4. **Metadata Validation Tools**

- **Custom Scripts**: Scripts that check for the presence and accuracy of all required metadata fields.
- **Linting Tools**: Tools to ensure metadata is correctly formatted in YAML or JSON, following APS standards.

## Metadata Usage and Governance

### Embedding Metadata in Documents

- Use the following template to ensure all required fields are included:

```yaml
