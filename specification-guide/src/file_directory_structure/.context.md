# File Directory Structure Context

The file directory structure for the **Agile Protocol Specification (APS)** is designed to provide a clear, organized, and efficient way to manage all project documents, whether they follow traditional agile practices or **Adversarial Agile Processes (AAP)**. This structure integrates all documents into a unified system, where both standard and adversarial roles and practices are represented.

## Architecture Overview

### Top-Level Directories

The directory structure is organized by **document states**, each representing a phase in the document lifecycle. These directories are:

1. **`drafts/`**: Contains all documents in the Draft state. These documents are actively being created or edited and are not yet finalized.
2. **`in-review/`**: Stores documents that are under review by stakeholders or subject matter experts. These documents require validation and feedback.
3. **`provisionals/`**: Holds documents that are in a stable form but may still be subject to minor adjustments before final acceptance.
4. **`accepted/`**: Includes all documents that have been reviewed, approved, and accepted for the current cycle. These documents are considered final for their purpose.
5. **`final/`**: Contains documents that are fully finalized and no longer open to modifications, except through new versioning.

### Subdirectories by Value Stream and Document Type

Each state directory contains subdirectories for different **value streams** and **document types**:

- **Value Streams**:
  - `product-development/`
  - `customer-support/`
  - (Other value streams as necessary)

- **Document Types**:
  - `context/`
  - `metrics/`
  - `pathway/`
  - (Other types as relevant to the APS)

### Configuration Files

A dedicated **`config/`** directory under the `current/` directory stores configuration files that define the settings and specifications for agile practices:

- `ProductDevelopment_AgileSpec_APM_v5.234.9.yaml`
- `CustomerSupport_PathwayConfig_APM_v3.4_Accepted_2024-09-10_ADoe.yaml`

### Historical Archives

The **`archives/`** directory holds older or deprecated documents that are no longer actively used but preserved for reference. Documents are organized by year, and each year contains subdirectories with archived files.

## Naming Conventions and Metadata

### File Naming Format

- Files must follow the standardized naming format:  
  `<ProjectArea>_<DocumentType>_<Role>_<Version>_<State>_<Date>_<Author>.<extension>`

- **Example**:
  - `ProductDevelopment_Context_AF_v2024-09_Draft_2024-09-01_JSmith.md`
  - `CustomerSupport_SprintBacklog_APM_v2024-09-01_Sprint-120_InReview_2024-09-01_JDoe.yaml`

### Metadata Requirements

- Each file must include detailed metadata headers using YAML or JSON to provide context and ensure consistency. These headers should specify the document title, version, state, author, and other relevant information.

## Rationale for the Unified Directory Structure

1. **Clarity and Accessibility**: Organizing files by state and value stream provides immediate clarity about their status and purpose, reducing time spent searching for documents.
2. **Flexibility**: A unified structure supports both traditional agile practices and AAP within the same framework, allowing teams to adapt dynamically to changing project needs.
3. **Enhanced Governance**: Clear organization supports better governance, compliance, and auditability by maintaining transparent records of document states and transitions.
4. **Efficient Integration**: Simplifies the integration of AI tools and automation scripts by providing a predictable and consistent file structure.

## Best Practices

- Ensure all new files are placed in the correct directory according to their current state.
- Follow the metadata-rich naming conventions strictly to maintain consistency.
- Regularly review and update the context files as documents transition between states to reflect their current status accurately.

## Conclusion

This context defines a unified and structured approach to managing all documents within the **APS** framework, supporting both human and AI contributors in agile environments. By adhering to these guidelines, teams can maintain a well-organized repository that enhances collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement.
