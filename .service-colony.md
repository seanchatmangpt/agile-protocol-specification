Typed Predictors
In DSPy Signatures, we have InputField and OutputField that define the nature of inputs and outputs of the field. However, the inputs and output to these fields are always str-typed, which requires input and output string processing.

Pydantic BaseModel is a great way to enforce type constraints on the fields, but it is not directly compatible with the dspy.Signature. Typed Predictors resolves this as a way to enforce the type constraints on the inputs and outputs of the fields in a dspy.Signature.

Executing Typed Predictors
Using Typed Predictors is not too different than any other module with the minor additions of type hints to signature attributes and using a special Predictor module instead of dspy.Predict. Let's take a look at a simple example to understand this.

Defining Input and Output Models
Let's take a simple task as an example i.e. given the context and query, the LLM should return an answer and confidence_score. Let's define our Input and Output models via pydantic.

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Input(BaseModel):
    context: str = Field(description="The context for the question")
    query: str = Field(description="The question to be answered")

class Output(BaseModel):
    answer: str = Field(description="The answer for the question")
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0, le=1, description="The confidence score for the answer")

As you can see, we can describe the attributes by defining a simple Signature that takes in the input and returns the output.

Creating Typed Predictor
A Typed Predictor needs a Typed Signature, which extends a dspy.Signature with the addition of specifying "field type".

class QASignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Answer the question based on the context and query provided, and on the scale of 10 tell how confident you are about the answer."""

    input: Input = dspy.InputField()
    output: Output = dspy.OutputField()


Now that we have the QASignature, let's define a Typed Predictor that executes this Signature while conforming to the type constraints.

predictor = dspy.TypedPredictor(QASignature)

Similar to other modules, we pass the QASignature to dspy.TypedPredictor which enforces the typed constraints.

And similarly to dspy.Predict, we can also use a "string signature", which we type as:

predictor = dspy.TypedPredictor("input:Input -> output:Output")

I/O in Typed Predictors
Now let's test out the Typed Predictor by providing some sample input to the predictor and verifying the output type. We can create an Input instance and pass it to the predictor to get a dictionary of the output.

doc_query_pair = Input(
    context="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    query="What does the fox jumps over?",
)

prediction = predictor(input=doc_query_pair)

Let's see the output and its type.

answer = prediction.output.answer
confidence_score = prediction.output.confidence

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}\n\n")
print(f"Answer: {answer}, Answer Type: {type(answer)}")
print(f"Confidence Score: {confidence_score}, Confidence Score Type: {type(confidence_score)}")

Conclusion
Introduction
To provide a complete representation of agile processes, it's beneficial to incorporate models that capture different dimensions:

Time: Scheduling, durations, dependencies (Gantt charts).
Processes: Workflow, activities, and decision points (BPMN).
Architecture: System structure and components (C4 model).
By connecting Gantt charts, BPMN, and C4, we can enhance the APS framework to represent both time (when things happen) and space (where things happen within the system architecture).

Understanding the Models
Gantt Charts
Purpose: Visualize project schedules, showing activities over time, durations, start and end dates, and dependencies between tasks.
Represents: Time dimension in project management.
BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)
Purpose: Provide a graphical representation of business processes, depicting workflows, activities, events, gateways (decision points), and interactions between participants.
Represents: Process flows and activities within a business context.
C4 Model
Purpose: Describe software architecture at multiple levels of abstraction:
Context: High-level view of the system and its environment.
Containers: Applications and data stores that make up the system.
Components: Internal components within containers.
Code: Detailed design and implementation details.
Represents: Spatial structure of the software system.
Representing Time and Space in APS
In the context of APS:

Time is represented by schedules, sprint timelines, and sequencing of activities.
Space is represented by the architectural components where activities occur.
By integrating Gantt charts, BPMN, and C4, we can:

Map activities and tasks to specific time frames (Gantt charts).
Define detailed workflows and processes (BPMN).
Align activities with system architecture components (C4 model).
Integrating the Models into APS
Gantt Charts in APS
Incorporate Gantt charts to visualize the scheduling of processes, activities, and tasks defined in APS.
Benefits:
Provides a timeline for processes and activities.

End Event: Feature deployed.
3. Map Activities on a Gantt Chart
Schedule tasks over time:
Week 1:
Design authentication module.
Week 2:
Develop login functionality.
Write unit tests.
Week 3:
Perform integration testing.
Conduct security testing.
Dependencies:
Testing tasks depend on the completion of development tasks.
4. Represent Architecture with C4 Model
Context Level:
The system interacts with users and external authentication services.
Container Level:
Web Application (Container): Where the login functionality resides.
Database (Container): Stores user credentials.
Component Level:
Authentication Service (Component): Handles login requests.
User Interface (Component): Login page.
Code Level:
Classes and methods implementing authentication logic.
5. Connect the Models
Align BPMN activities with C4 components:
Design and development tasks correspond to the Authentication Service component.
Schedule BPMN activities on the Gantt chart:
Place tasks on the timeline according to the plan.
Use the C4 model to identify where tasks occur within the system architecture.
BPMN diagrams provide the workflow, while Gantt charts provide the timing, and C4 models provide the structural context.

Using a mermaidjs diagram show a loop that iterates on APS YAML
ChatGPT

Thought for a few seconds

Certainly! Below is a MermaidJS diagram that illustrates a loop iterating over the APS YAML structure. This diagram represents the process of loading the APS YAML file, parsing its contents, and iterating through its various components such as roles, activities, tasks, scenarios, and more.

Explanation of the Diagram
Start: The beginning of the process.

Load APS YAML File: The APS YAML file is loaded into the system.

Parse YAML Content: The loaded YAML content is parsed to convert it into a workable data structure (e.g., Python dictionary).

Initialize Iteration Over APS Components: Preparation steps before starting the iteration over different components of the APS.

Check Components: A decision point to determine if there are more components to process. If Yes, the loop continues; if No, the process ends.

Process Roles: Iterates and processes each role defined in the APS YAML.

Process Activities: Iterates and processes each activity.

Process Tasks: Iterates and processes each task within activities.

Process Scenarios: Iterates and processes each scenario.

Process Data Structures: Iterates and processes data tables and doc strings.

Process Annotations: Iterates and processes annotations or tags.

Process Comments: Iterates and processes comments within the APS YAML.

Process Localization: Iterates and processes localization settings.

End: The process concludes after all components have been processed.

How to Use the Diagram
To visualize this diagram:

Markdown with Mermaid Support: If you're using a Markdown editor or platform that supports Mermaid (like GitHub, GitLab, or certain documentation tools), you can embed the diagram directly using the code block provided above.

Mermaid Live Editor: You can also use the Mermaid Live Editor to paste the code and visualize the diagram interactively.

Integration in Documentation: Incorporate this diagram into your project documentation to provide a clear overview of how the system iterates over the APS YAML structure.

Additional Enhancements
Depending on your specific use case, you might want to further detail each processing step. For example:

Error Handling: Add steps to handle potential errors during parsing or processing.

Data Validation: Incorporate validation steps to ensure the YAML content adheres to the expected schema.

Output Generation: Include steps that describe what happens after processing each component, such as generating reports or updating databases.

Example with Enhanced Details
Here's an enhanced version of the diagram that includes error handling and data validation:

6 DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss the introduction of external tools, the hidden costs of user decisions, and the scalability and
generalizability of our framework, based on some error analysis.
External tools with Discussion: We discuss the issue of external tools on two levels: the Potential benefits of
integrating external tools into Our method and the benefit of introducing external tools to generate software applications.
1) Potential Benefits of Integrating External Tools into Our Method: Our method integrates the SQLite3 external
database tool in the memory pool to save human decision experiences. SQLite3 was chosen because it is an open-source,
lightweight, embedded relational database management system that does not require server configuration. SQLite3
supports most SQL standard syntax, allowing us to use SQL syntax to access human experiences in the database.
Of course, if we need high concurrency and complex query functions in the future, it can easily be integrated with
server-side database management tools. More importantly, our method is based on behavior-driven development (BDD),
with the scenario design module containing users’ clarified Gherkin scenarios. These Gherkin scenarios serve as test
cases, and in the future, we can directly integrate the external Cucumber testing tool to conduct tests. The feedback
from these test cases can be used to improve code quality. Since Gherkin focuses more on the consistency between
implementation code and business logic, introducing the Cucumber testing tool will help generate software applications
that align with user expectations, reducing manual iterations. For example, the initial scenario generation in the "09
Sound Board" project includes "Then the website plays the pronunciation of the word ’Apple.’" However, "Round 1"
does not generate the pronunciation functionality. If we introduce the external Cucumber tool, it would automatically
test and modify the functionality, reducing the need for additional manual iterations. This will be a key focus of our
future research.
2) Benefits of Introducing External Tools to Our Generated Software Applications: During software applications generation, large language models (e.g., GPT-4) have hallucination problems, resulting in generated real multimedia API failure.
To maintain the display effect of web application interfaces, we typically replace multimedia resources with placeholders
during automatic generation. However, some projects rely on images to present their visual effects. Placeholder images
are often gray and provide a poor visual experience, which can result in participants giving lower visual scores even if
the functionality is complete. For example, the project "ID50 Catch The Insect" should involve clicking on insect images
to catch them, but the game theme can be confusing without the insect images. Similarly, the "ID48 Random Image Feed"
project requires multimedia resources for display, but automatically generated resource links often do not meet the
requirements. Our method allows for specifying certain resource APIs through human-agent collaboration, as shown
27https://github.com/HarrisClover/AgileGen-Human-Agent-Interaction-Experiment/tree/main/Gomoku
Manuscript submitted to ACM
40 S. Zhang et al.
in Figure 19. This interaction process made us realize that incorporating external API tools can enable our generated
end-user applications to achieve more complex functionalities. In the "SRDD" dataset, for instance, the "NewsMeter"
project aims to complete a news credibility analysis function, as shown in Figure 14. Our method generates a reasonable
simulation process, including data display interfaces in the code. If a suitable news analysis API is introduced, it could
easily result in a genuine news analysis website system. Of course, we need to consider the reliable sources and stable
references of APIs and the different response schemas of each API. Completing the functionality of an API with complex
input and output data may require further restricting the generation format of software applications. In summary, the
introduction of external API tools would enhance the scope of applications generated by our method, and we will
consider this in our future work.
Hidden Costs of User Decisions: In our method, users can participate in decision-making steps, including "end-user
requirements decision-making," "scenario decision-making," and "acceptance & recommendation decision-making."
Therefore, we discuss these in three parts.
1) “End-User Requirements Decision-making": This is when users propose the initial requirements for the software
applications in our system. Our method accommodates requirements that are simple natural language descriptions, as
shown in Table 3, rather than complex requirement specifications. This reduces the domain knowledge and learning
costs required from end-users during the requirements decision-making.
2) “Scenario Decision-making": This involves users adding, deleting, or modifying the generated Gherkin scenarios
in our system to clarify their requirements further. We designed a memory pool module to reduce the time cost for
users when modifying scenarios. This module accumulates previous user decision experiences and recommends similar
scenarios for future similar projects. However, to ensure fairness in the experimental setup, we did not provide any
human experience before testing all projects, so the impact of the memory pool can only be measured later. Our design
mechanism accumulates human experiences over time, reducing user decision costs as more tests are conducted. In
the future, we plan to deploy our method on a public testing platform to collect more human experiences over time,
demonstrating the process of continuous enhancement through human-in-the-loop interactions. Additionally, we built
an interaction bridge to reduce the learning cost for users when adding and modifying Gherkin scenarios, allowing
users to add and modify functionalities using natural language seamlessly.
3) “Acceptance & Recommendation Decision-making": This allows users to review the software application and
iteratively recommend modifications in our system. To reduce the learning cost for users when executing applications
during acceptance, we set up a "Code Execution Link" in the system. Users can click the link easily to test the web
application interface. To reduce the number of iterations for user recommendation decisions, we designed a consistency
factor that automatically modifies the code to improve alignment with user requirements. Lastly, we can further reduce
the number of manual iterative recommendation modifications in the future. Since our method is based on behaviordriven development (BDD), we can easily introduce the external tool Cucumber for automated testing of the generated
code and targeted modifications. This approach will significantly enhance the consistency between implementation
code and business logic, reducing user decision costs during "acceptance & recommendation decision-making."
Scalability and Generalizability Discussion: 1) In terms of scalability: First, our method is based on Gherkin
scenario test cases, which can easily be extended to include external Cucumber testing tools. This targeted modification
of the generated code would significantly improve code quality. Second, when facing future high concurrency and
complex queries in the human experience memory pool, the SQLite3 database can be expanded to MySQL or other
server-side data management systems. Finally, our system harnesses the capabilities of large language models but is not
limited to a specific model. Thus, it can be easily extended to various models, demonstrating high scalability.

2) In terms of generalizability: First, our framework can be applied to any software development project. By adopting
behavior-driven development (BDD) based on agile principles, we ensure the consistency of generated code with business
logic. This innovative behavior-driven code generation approach is not confined to web application development. If we
want our framework to support mobile application development, we can change the visual design components and the
programming language of the code generation components. Finally, our method has received high user satisfaction
and interaction experience ratings from participants in various industries, validating its generalizability in generating
software applications. Thus, our method demonstrates high generalizability in its framework design and final generated
software application.
7 RELATED WORK
This paper first introduces an AI agent for generative software development (AgileGen) based on an Agile methodologies
and through human-AI Teamwork. It allows end-users and AI to handle tasks they excel at, collaboratively piecing
together the development process. The related work is as follows:
7.1 Automated code generation
In recent years, automated code generation tasks have been achieved using deep learning to generate code automatically [4, 25, 39, 44, 45, 50]. Automated code generation tasks are divided into tree-based and token-based methods [39].
Tree-based methods generate code by producing tree structures or Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) [11, 25, 51]. Meanwhile,
token-based methods [4, 44, 45, 50] treat the input and output code as sequences of tokens. There is also a type of
template-based code generation. [42] is a tool for the automatic generation of web software and API code based on
templates. With the software of large pre-trained models in code generation tasks, token-based methods have shown remarkable results. CodeT5 [7] introduced identifier-aware pre-training tasks based on T5. CodeGPT [24], CodeBERT [12],
and CodeGeeX [21] utilize various programming languages for pre-training. CodeX [46] is a GPT-based model that
underwent pre-training on a large scale of GitHub code and launched a productivity version named GitHub Copilot [9].
These powerful pre-trained models can generate high-quality code snippets during software development, enhancing
developers’ productivity through pair programming. This lays the foundation for automatically generative software
development [35]. However, these large pre-trained code generation models mainly focus on generating high-quality
code snippets within a single file.
7.2 Generative Software Development
Generative software development has long been a focus of attention in industry and academia. Paolone et al. [27]
proposed a model-driven architecture (MDA)-based approach using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and xGenerator
to generate website applications. Boyalakuntla et al. [5] aimed to reduce smartphone battery consumption by creating a
meta-model and generating location-based software. Bernaschina et al. [3] developed a model-driven development tool
that automatically generates rapid prototypes of web and mobile software from Interaction Flow Modeling Language
(IFML) specifications.
Large language models such as ChatGPT [2] have been widely applied in software development and demonstrated
potential. Microsoft researchers Bubeck et al. [6] guide GPT-4 to the development of complex HTML games. Some
Python project generators based on GPT have been released on Huggingface [13], generating function architecture
based on brief requirements. AutoGPT [1] has been explored for generating HTML projects without manual prompting.
Intelligent tools can help developers be more productive, but they need precise models and expert knowledge to work

well. Similar projects include DemoGPT28, which utilizes the Streamlit visualization tool and can rapidly transform a
single prompt into an AI software with the prompted functionality. This fully autonomous AI operates without human
intervention in its internal processes and is prone to issues such as process freezing. Then, some questioning-based
agents have been proposed. GPT-Engineer [14] is a project that automates the software engineering process using
GPT-4, initially clarifying requirements through questions to the user before automatically generating code. Similarly,
gpt-pilot29, based on GPT-4, generates software code after asking developers to clarify questions. These methods aim to
assist developers; thus, the questions often require professional domain knowledge.
Recently, the concept of multi-agent collaboration has been introduced. Generative Agents [28] simulate human
behavior by allowing agents to interact collaboratively through dialogue. CodeAgent [41] conducts code reviews
through the collaboration of multiple agents led by a QA-checker. Inspired by this collaborative interaction among
agents, MetaGPT [17] utilizes standard operating procedures to coordinate a multi-agent system based on large language
models, with different agents simulating different software development roles. Subsequently, MetaGPT proposed a
solution for multi-agent collaboration in data science applications [16]. ChatDev first version [30] designs a dialogue
chain-guided, multi-agent collaborative software development agent. Based on the original prototype of ChatDev, two
versions were updated. The ChatDev second version [31] adopts experiential co-learning, collecting shortcut-oriented
experiences from their historical trajectory for use in software development. The ChatDev third version [32] refines
these historical experiences through iteration before using them in software development. The fourth version of
ChatDev [33] uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to organize agents. Employing topological sorting simplifies agent
interaction reasoning and enhances collaboration among agents. These agents follow the waterfall model, characterized
by heavy documentation and process emphasis. However, they offer lower levels of human participation and control,
and the hallucination errors of each agent can cascade, making it challenging to generate software products that meet
user requirements. As a result, these tools are not user-friendly for end-users who wish to tailored software in software
development.
7.3 Requirement Generation
Unclear requirements are a primary difficulty in generative software development, as end-users often need more
domain knowledge to articulate their needs precisely. The requirements are generally expressed in a natural language
of one to two sentences. The goal of the requirement generation task is to produce clear requirements. Existing
research on automated requirement generation primarily focuses on converting (semi-)structured models into natural
language requirement specifications with specific syntactic patterns [23, 26, 40]. Few studies pay attention to generating
requirement specifications from keywords provided by requirement analysts [52]. They fine-tune UniLM by associating
keyword knowledge and reinforcing relevancy, integrating a copy mechanism to meet the hard constraints of keywords,
and employing grammar-constrained decoding to satisfy grammatical requirements. However, end-users struggle to
possess the knowledge required to construct precise models or describe professional keywords.
This paper introduces an agile-based AI agent for generative app development through human-AI teamwork
(AgileGen). It generates acceptance criteria presented in the Gherkin language from the incomplete requirements of
end-users. The Gherkin is then translated into scenarios described in natural language for users to make decisions,
thereby clarifying end-user requirements. The code generation component produces interface designs and consistency
factors based on scenarios that have been decided upon. The consistency factors guide code generation to ensure the

app product meets the end-user’s requirements. The final, workable app product is presented to the end-users for
acceptance and recommendations, and then the next iteration cycle is entered. Our AgileGen is designed for end-users
who can easily generate satisfactory software without the need for domain knowledge.
8 CONCLUSION
This paper constructs a bridge for generative app development based on Agile methodologies between end-users and
the Agent, enabling them to handle tasks in which they are proficient in teamwork. This approach avoids the error
propagation caused by top-down waterfall model thinking and reduces the professional need for domain knowledge in
clarifying requirements. Aimed at satisfying user requirements, it overcomes the gap between end-user requirements
and agents’ technical implementation. We first introduce the AgileGen framework, which is Agile-based for generative
software development. This framework incorporates behavior-driven development, requiring end-users to make three
decisions: Requirement Decision-making, Scenarios Decision-making, and Acceptance & Recommendations, to develop
reliable software applications through human-agent collaboration. We utilize the Gherkin language with acceptance
criteria to describe user stories, expanding user requirements into different scenarios. We generate factors consistent
with business logic from these testable user stories, which drives code generation. This factor ensures that end-user
requirements align with the app’s business logic while optimizing the end-user experience. Moreover, we have developed
AgileGen as a user-friendly interactive system. Due to its high scalability and generalizability design philosophy, we
can extend our method to various human-collaborative tasks. In the future, we will incorporate appropriate external
tools such as Cucumber to implement automated testing iterations. This will further enhance the consistency of the
generated software with business logic

6.3 Ablation Study
For the evaluation, we randomly select samples
from eSNLI and deploy Qwen2-7B as both the generator and the critic, maintaining an analogous experimental setting to SELF-REFINE (Madaan et al.,
2023), as SELF-REFINE shares the most similarity
to our approach. We then generate explanations
with and without a certain component and the automated metrics (§5.1) are applied to each set of
generated explanations to assess their quality.
Table 3 shows that while BARTScore slightly
increases when using CROSS-REFINE without suggestions to refine the explanations, BLEURT and
TIGERScore experience a sharp reduction. In contrast, when using CROSS-REFINE without feedback,
all scores decline to some extent, but not as sigFeedback Suggestion BLEURT BARTScore TIGERScore

nificantly as in the case of CROSS-REFINE without
suggestions. Meanwhile, since we use the same
LLM for both the generator and the critic in the
ablation study (“self CROSS-REFINE”), and SELFREFINE relies solely on self-feedback, making the
feedback comparable between two approaches, we
deduce that suggestions play an equally important
role in the refinement of explanations.
Influence of Suggestions To measure the influence of suggestions, we evaluate the semantic similarity using SBERT11 between the refined explanation and the initial explanation, as well as between
the refined explanation and the suggestions individually. Table 4 indicates that, in general, the refined
explanations align more closely with the suggestions than with the initial explanations, which implies that the “cross-refinement” steps effectively
prompt changes to the initial explanation. This process encourages LLMs to “rethink” and correct the
initial explanations if they are stated incorrectly.
6.4 CROSS-REFINE on German Data
For automatic evaluation, we discard BLEURT
and TIGERScore, as they only support English.
For BARTScore, we use a different model that is
compatible with German. In addition, we deploy
MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) and BERTScore
(Zhang et al., 2020). MoverScore measures the semantic distance by contextualized representations

the token-level similarity between the reference
texts and the LLM outputs by leveraging contextual embeddings.
Table 5 demonstrates that, overall, CROSSREFINE produces better NLEs than SELF-REFINE
on HealthFC (German). Table 9 presents the percentage of the generated explanations in German.
We observe that Qwen2 and Llama3 consistently
outperform Mixtral in generating NLEs in German. Furthermore, SELF-REFINE is significantly
more likely to generate NLEs in other languages
instead of German compared to CROSS-REFINE12

7 Related Work
Refined Explanations Krishna et al. (2023) proposed to take advantage of post-hoc explanations
in in-context learning. Tong et al. (2024) found that
LLMs can benefit from correct examples and learn
from mistakes, while An et al. (2024) fine-tuned
LLMs using pairs consisting of errors and their respective corrections. The mixture of agents (MoA)
(Wang et al., 2024a) approach collects the strengths
of multiple LLMs by constructing a layered MoA
architecture and improves the reasoning by providing criticism. Moreover, LLMs can use selfgenerated feedback, refinement, or introspection as
means to enhance reasoning abilities (Huang et al.,
2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Xu
et al., 2024). Welleck et al. (2023) suggested to use
a base generator that proposes an initial hypothesis
and a trained corrector that iteratively improves its
quality. Compared to Welleck et al.’s (2023) approach, CROSS-REFINE does not necessarily require
the critic can completely correct the hypothesis, as
12See more details in Appendix J.
it can be very challenging (Huang et al., 2024b;
Tyen et al., 2024). Instead, CROSS-REFINE focuses
on providing feedback and suggested explanations
generated by the critic, which the generator can
use to refine its initial explanations. Furthermore,
CROSS-REFINE does not require supervised training
data collection that is used for corrector fine-tuning
(Welleck et al., 2023). Meanwhile, SELF-REFINE
leverages self generated feedback to refine the explanation iteratively (Madaan et al., 2023). Madaan
et al. (2023) showed that with SELF-REFINE, less
powerful LLMs struggle with explanation refinement, because they have difficulties in generating
suitable feedback and thus tend to repeat the same
output or generate hallucinated output. In comparison, since CROSS-REFINE deploys the critic,
the generator has an external source (i.e., feedback and suggestion) except for itself, which can
be cross-referenced. Because of cross-reference,
CROSS-REFINE can be highly effective for tasks
where LLMs have substantial knowledge. Moreover, CROSS-REFINE performs well with less powerful LLMs, compared to SELF-REFINE.
8 Conclusion
We introduced CROSS-REFINE, an approach that improves NLEs through cross-refinement based on
automated and human evaluation across various
tasks. CROSS-REFINE uses two LLMs for role modeling: One as the generator and the other as the
critic. The generator refines its initial explanations
by cross-referencing feedback and suggestions provided by the critic. Overall, CROSS-REFINE can outperform similar state-of-the-art approaches such
as SELF-REFINE and can refine the explanations
well with less powerful LLMs compared to SELFREFINE. For tasks that fall outside of the LLMs’
domain expertise, e.g., in the medical domain, and
require more structured domain knowledge, CROSSREFINE using the same LLM both as the generator
and the critic can surpass SELF-REFINE. Furthermore, since CROSS-REFINE introduces feedback
along with suggestions from the critic to refine
the generator’s initial explanation, through the ablation study, we observe that suggestions are as
crucial as feedback in refining explanations. Additionally, we find that CROSS-REFINE outperforms
SELF-REFINE when data is in German (HealthFC),
and with CROSS-REFINE, NLEs are more likely to
be generated in German compared to SELF-REFINE.
Limitations
Despite we created a collection of demonstrations,
FiXer, which includes various instances consisting
of initial explanations (generator), feedback and
suggested explanations (critic) and refined explanations (generator), we are limited to using a small
number of demonstrations (n ∈ [3, 10]) depending
on input length for few-shot prompting to refine
NLEs with CROSS-REFINE. This limitation is primarily due to constraints on context length, e.g.
Mixtral 7*8B has the context window with only
8k tokens13. We will consider using LONGLLMLINGUA (Jiang et al., 2024c) to compress the prompt
while the model performance can be enhanced.
We only performed experiments using datasets
in English and German (only for HealthFC). In
other languages, current models might not offer the
same advantages.
We have to use different automatic evaluation metrics or models for the German data in
HealthFC, as BLEURT and TIGERScore do not
support languages other than English.
Future work includes exploring whether humancrafted feedback and suggestions can align with
LLM generated ones. We plan to conduct a more
fine-grained error analysis to inspect to what extent
CROSS-REFINE can address the errors contained in
the explanations. We will explore how the interpretation of terminology of quality metrics, e.g.,
faithfulness or insightfulness, can impact the quality of the user study. Furthermore, we will investigate whether CROSS-REFINE using LLMs trained on
medical data can perform better on the HealthFC
dataset. In addition, we plan to incorporate human
interactions into the CROSS-REFINE workflow.

Example: Initializing a DSPyGen Project
python
Copy code
import typer
from pathlib import Path

app = typer.Typer()

@app.command()
def init(project_name: str):
    """
    Initialize a new DSPyGen project.
    """
    project_path = Path(project_name)
    project_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    (project_path / "modules").mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    (project_path / "scenarios").mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    (project_path / "logs").mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    typer.echo(f"Initialized new DSPyGen project at {project_path.resolve()}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
Example: Creating a New Module
python
Copy code
@app.command()
def module_new(class_name: str, inputs: str, output: str):
    """
    Create a new AI module.
    """
    inputs_list = inputs.split(",")
    module_dir = Path("modules") / class_name.lower()
    module_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    module_file = module_dir / f"{class_name.lower()}.py"
    
    with open(module_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(f"""import dspy

class {class_name}(dspy.Module):
    def forward(self, {', '.join(inputs_list)}):
        # TODO: Implement the {class_name} logic
        pass
""")
    typer.echo(f"Created new module: {module_file.resolve()}")
DSPyGen Modules
Modules in DSPyGen are the building blocks of AI pipelines. Each module encapsulates a specific AI task, such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, or code generation.

Example: TextSummarizer Module
python
Copy code
import dspy

class TextSummarizer(dspy.Signature):
    """
    Summarizes input text into a concise summary.
    """
    text = dspy.InputField(desc="Text to be summarized.")
    summary = dspy.OutputField(desc="Generated summary of the input text.")

class TextSummarizerModule(dspy.Module):
    """TextSummarizerModule"""

    def __init__(self, **forward_args):
        super().__init__()
        self.forward_args = forward_args
        self.output = None

    def forward(self, text):
        pred = dspy.Predict(TextSummarizer)
        self.output = pred(text=text).summary
        return self.output

def text_summarizer_call(text):
    summarizer = TextSummarizerModule()
    return summarizer.forward(text=text)
Workflow Automation with Sungen
Sungen automates complex workflows, enabling seamless integration of various development tasks. It utilizes BPMN and YAML configurations to define and execute workflows, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

Example: Automating CI/CD Pipeline
yaml
Copy code
# ci_cd_workflow.yaml

workflow:
  name: "Continuous Integration and Deployment"
  steps:
    - name: "Code Checkout"
      action: "git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git"
    - name: "Run Tests"
      action: "pytest tests/"
    - name: "Build Docker Image"
      action: "docker build -t your-app ."
    - name: "Deploy to Production"
      action: "docker-compose up -d"
Executing the Workflow
python
Copy code
import yaml
import subprocess
from pathlib import Path

def execute_workflow(workflow_file: str):
    with open(workflow_file, 'r') as f:
        workflow = yaml.safe_load(f)
    
    for step in workflow['workflow']['steps']:
        typer.echo(f"Executing Step: {step['name']}")
        result = subprocess.run(step['action'], shell=True)
        if result.returncode != 0:
            typer.echo(f"Step '{step['name']}' failed.")
            break
        typer.echo(f"Step '{step['name']}' completed successfully.")

@app.command()
def workflow_execute(workflow_file: str):
    """
    Execute a defined workflow.
    """
    execute_workflow(workflow_file)
    typer.echo("Workflow execution completed.")

Introduction
Model-based testing (MBT) has emerged as a powerful methodology for enhancing the verification and validation of software systems. By leveraging formal models to generate test cases, MBT can improve test coverage, reduce redundancy, and adapt to evolving requirements. Despite its advantages, the adoption of MBT in industry has been hindered by several factors, including the complexity of model creation, the disconnect between technical specifications and business-level requirements, and the challenges posed by dynamic system specifications [1].

One significant barrier is the difficulty developers face in transitioning from linear, customer-centric specifications to abstract, model-based representations required for MBT. Traditional specifications, often written in natural language formats like Gherkin [8], are intuitive for non-technical stakeholders but lack the formal structure necessary for automated testing tools such as QuickCheck [2]. Additionally, the dynamic nature of commercial systems, which frequently undergo specification changes, exacerbates the challenge of maintaining accurate and up-to-date models.

To address these challenges, we propose PLAN Pro, an architectural framework designed to integrate Agile Protocol Specifications (APS) with MBT within service colony architectures. PLAN Pro facilitates the automatic conversion of Gherkin-based specifications into machine-readable models, enabling comprehensive inter-scenario testing and leveraging telemetry for real-time system monitoring and adaptation. This integration not only bridges the gap between business-level requirements and technical testing but also enhances the scalability and adaptability of testing processes in dynamic environments.

This paper presents the following contributions:

PLAN Pro Framework: A detailed description of PLAN Pro, illustrating how it integrates APS with MBT within service colony architectures.
Automated Specification Conversion: A methodology for transforming Gherkin-based specifications into QuickCheck-compatible models, enabling automated inter-scenario testing.
Telemetry Integration: An approach for incorporating telemetry data into the testing framework, allowing for real-time monitoring and system adaptation.
Case Study: An application of PLAN Pro to Malta’s national health portal, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing test coverage and system reliability.
Addressing Common Misconceptions: Clarification of prevalent misunderstandings regarding APS and PLAN Pro to foster better comprehension and adoption.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in MBT, APS, and service colony architectures. Section 3 introduces the PLAN Pro framework and its components. Section 4 details the automated specification conversion process. Section 5 discusses the integration of telemetry data. Section 6 presents the case study on Malta’s national health portal. Section 7 addresses common misconceptions, and Section 8 concludes the paper with future work directions.

Related Work
Model-based testing has been extensively studied and applied across various domains to improve software quality [3]. Traditional MBT approaches involve creating formal models that represent the desired behavior of the system under test (SUT). These models are then used to generate test cases automatically [4]. Tools like QuickCheck [2] have popularized property-based testing, allowing developers to specify properties that their code should satisfy, with the tool generating test cases to validate these properties.

Agile methodologies, particularly Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) [3], emphasize close collaboration between developers and non-technical stakeholders. BDD employs natural language specifications, often written in Gherkin [8], to define system behaviors in terms of Given-When-Then scenarios. While BDD enhances communication and ensures alignment with business requirements, it presents challenges when integrating with MBT tools that require formal models.

Service colony architectures, which structure systems as a collection of interacting agents, have gained traction for their scalability and resilience [5]. Integrating MBT within such architectures necessitates efficient communication protocols and robust monitoring mechanisms to handle the dynamic interactions between agents.

Existing literature highlights the gap between natural language specifications and formal models required for MBT. Efforts to bridge this gap include tools that translate Gherkin scenarios into formal representations, yet these solutions often lack automation and fail to accommodate the evolving nature of commercial specifications [6]. Additionally, the integration of telemetry data into testing frameworks remains underexplored, despite its potential to enhance system monitoring and adaptive testing.

PLAN Pro addresses these gaps by providing a structured approach to convert Gherkin-based specifications into machine-readable models suitable for MBT tools like QuickCheck. Furthermore, by incorporating telemetry data into the testing process, PLAN Pro enables real-time monitoring and system adaptation, ensuring that testing remains robust in the face of dynamic system changes.

PLAN Pro Framework
Overview
PLAN Pro is an architectural framework designed to integrate Agile Protocol Specifications (APS) with model-based testing within service colony architectures. It automates the conversion of Gherkin-based specifications into formal models compatible with MBT tools and incorporates telemetry data to facilitate real-time monitoring and system adaptation. The framework comprises the following key components:

Agile Protocol Specification (APS): Defines machine-readable specifications that outline agent roles, communications, and telemetry data structures within the service colony.
Specification Converter: Transforms Gherkin-based scenarios into QuickCheck-compatible models, enabling automated inter-scenario testing.
Telemetry Integration Module: Collects, processes, and utilizes telemetry data to monitor system performance and trigger adaptive responses.
Service Colony Agents: A collection of agents (e.g., Service Agents, Telemetry Agents, Monitor Agents) that interact based on APS-defined protocols and contribute to system functionality and monitoring.
Model-Based Testing Engine: Utilizes QuickCheck to generate and execute test cases derived from the converted specifications, ensuring comprehensive system validation.

Components Detail
Agile Protocol Specification (APS)
APS is a YAML-based specification language that defines the roles of agents, communication protocols, and telemetry data structures within the service colony. By formalizing these aspects, APS ensures that agent interactions are consistent, machine-readable, and conducive to automated testing.

Specification Converter
The Specification Converter automates the transformation of Gherkin-based specifications into QuickCheck-compatible models. It parses Gherkin scenarios, extracts relevant information, and generates formal properties that QuickCheck can use to generate and execute test cases. This automation bridges the gap between business-level specifications and technical testing requirements.

Telemetry Integration Module
This module is responsible for collecting telemetry data from various agents, processing the data to extract meaningful metrics and events, and integrating this information into the testing framework. By leveraging telemetry, the system can monitor performance in real-time, identify anomalies, and trigger adaptive testing processes to maintain system reliability.

Service Colony Agents
Service Colony consists of various agents, each with defined roles and responsibilities as specified by APS. Key agents include:

Service Agents: Perform dedicated functionalities and interact with other agents.
Telemetry Agents: Collect and process telemetry data from Service Agents.
Monitor Agents: Analyze telemetry data, detect anomalies, and trigger system adaptations.
Model-Based Testing Engine
Utilizing QuickCheck, the MBT Engine generates test cases based on the formal models produced by the Specification Converter. These test cases are designed to explore different scenarios, including inter-scenario interactions, ensuring thorough validation of the system against its specifications.

Automated Specification Conversion
Motivation
Gherkin-based specifications, while accessible to non-technical stakeholders, lack the formal structure required for automated model-based testing. Manual conversion of these specifications into formal models is error-prone and time-consuming, especially in dynamic environments where specifications frequently change. Automating this conversion process is essential to maintain consistency, reduce manual effort, and ensure that testing remains aligned with business requirements.

Conversion Process
The Specification Converter within PLAN Pro follows a structured process to transform Gherkin scenarios into QuickCheck-compatible models:

Parsing Gherkin Specifications:

Utilize a YAML parser to read Gherkin-based APS documents.
Extract features, scenarios, and step definitions from the specifications.
Mapping Steps to Properties:

Analyze each Given-When-Then step to identify preconditions, actions, and expected outcomes.
Translate these steps into formal properties that QuickCheck can interpret.
Generating QuickCheck Models:

For each scenario, create a corresponding QuickCheck property that encapsulates the desired behavior.
Define state transitions and interactions between different scenarios to enable inter-scenario testing.
Handling Dynamic Specifications:

Implement versioning mechanisms to track changes in specifications.
Automatically update QuickCheck models upon detecting modifications in Gherkin scenarios.
Example Conversion
Gherkin Scenario:

gherkin
Copy code
Feature: Doctor’s landing page

Scenario: Navigate to lab results page
  Given I am on the doctor's landing page
  When I click on laboratory results
  Then I should go to the lab results page

Scenario: Navigate back to Doctor’s landing page
  Given I am on the lab results page
  When I click on the myHealth logo
  Then I should go to the doctor's landing page
Converted QuickCheck Model:

haskell
Copy code
-- QuickCheck property for navigating to lab results page
prop_navigateToLabResults :: State -> Property
prop_navigateToLabResults state =
  state == LandingPage ==> 
    navigate "laboratory results" == LabResultsPage

-- QuickCheck property for navigating back to landing page
prop_navigateBack :: State -> Property
prop_navigateBack state =
  state == LabResultsPage ==> 
    navigate "myHealth logo" == LandingPage
Explanation:

Each scenario is converted into a QuickCheck property that defines the expected state transitions.
Preconditions (Given) and actions (When) are mapped to conditions and function calls (navigate) in QuickCheck.
Expected outcomes (Then) define the expected state after the action.
Implementation Considerations
Scalability: Ensure that the converter can handle large sets of Gherkin scenarios efficiently.
Extensibility: Design the converter to accommodate additional Gherkin features and custom step definitions.
Error Handling: Implement robust error detection and reporting mechanisms to handle malformed specifications gracefully.
Integration with Version Control: Link the converter with version control systems to track changes and manage model updates effectively.
Telemetry Integration
Importance of Telemetry in MBT
Telemetry plays a crucial role in modern software systems by providing real-time insights into system performance, resource utilization, and user interactions. Integrating telemetry data into the MBT framework enhances the ability to monitor system health, detect anomalies, and adapt testing strategies dynamically. This integration ensures that testing remains relevant and effective in the face of evolving system behaviors and external factors.

Telemetry Data Structures
Telemetry data is structured to capture essential metrics and events that reflect the system's operational state. The following data structures are defined within the APS documents to standardize telemetry data collection:

Metrics
CPU Usage: Percentage of CPU resources used by Service Agents.
Memory Usage: Amount of memory (in MB) used by Service Agents.
Response Time: Average response time (in ms) of Service Agents.
Events
High CPU Usage: Triggered when CPU usage exceeds 80%.
Memory Leak Detected: Triggered when memory usage consistently increases over time.
Slow Response Time: Triggered when response time exceeds 500 ms.
Telemetry Collection and Processing
Service Agents
Service Agents periodically collect telemetry data during their operations. The collect_telemetry method gathers metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and response time. This data is then sent to the Telemetry Agent for processing.

python
Copy code
# service_agent.py (Excerpt)

def collect_telemetry(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    telemetry_data = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "agent_name": self.name,
        "state": self.state,
        "cpu_usage": self.get_cpu_usage(),
        "memory_usage": self.get_memory_usage(),
        "response_time": self.get_response_time()
    }
    return telemetry_data
Telemetry Agent
The Telemetry Agent receives telemetry data from Service Agents, processes it to identify events based on predefined conditions, and forwards relevant information to the Monitor Agent if thresholds are exceeded.

python
Copy code
# telemetry_agent.py (Excerpt)

def handle_telemetry(self, telemetry: Dict[str, Any]):
    self.telemetry_data.append(telemetry)
    print(f"[{self.name}] Collected telemetry data: {telemetry}")
    # Forward telemetry data to Monitor Agent if necessary
    self.send_message(receiver="MonitorAgent", subject="Telemetry Update", content=telemetry)
Monitor Agent
The Monitor Agent analyzes incoming telemetry data against defined thresholds to detect anomalies. Upon identifying an event, it triggers system adaptations by communicating with Service Agents.

python
Copy code
# monitor_agent.py (Excerpt)

def analyze_telemetry(self, telemetry: Dict[str, Any]):
    alerts = []
    if telemetry["cpu_usage"] > self.thresholds["cpu_usage"]:
        alerts.append(f"High CPU Usage: {telemetry['cpu_usage']}%")
    if telemetry["memory_usage"] > self.thresholds["memory_usage"]:
        alerts.append(f"High Memory Usage: {telemetry['memory_usage']}MB")
    if telemetry["response_time"] > self.thresholds["response_time"]:
        alerts.append(f"Slow Response Time: {telemetry['response_time']}ms")

    for alert in alerts:
        self.trigger_adaptation(alert)
Triggering Adaptations
When the Monitor Agent detects an anomaly, it sends adaptation requests to Service Agents to perform actions such as scaling up resources or optimizing performance.

python
Copy code
# monitor_agent.py (Excerpt)

def trigger_adaptation(self, alert: str):
    print(f"[{self.name}] Triggering adaptation due to: {alert}")
    adaptation_message = {
        "alert": alert,
        "action": "scale_up"
    }
    self.send_message(receiver="ServiceAgent", subject="Adaptation Request", content=adaptation_message)
Case Study: Malta’s National Health Portal
Overview
To validate the effectiveness of PLAN Pro, we applied the framework to Malta’s national health portal—a critical web application serving Maltese residents. The portal manages sensitive health data, schedules appointments, and provides access to medical records. Ensuring its reliability and performance is paramount.

Objectives
Automate Test Case Generation: Convert existing Gherkin-based specifications into QuickCheck models for automated MBT.
Enhance Test Coverage: Include inter-scenario interactions to identify potential issues arising from sequential operations.
Integrate Telemetry: Monitor system performance in real-time and adapt testing strategies based on telemetry insights.
Implementation
Specification Conversion
We began by converting the portal’s Gherkin specifications into QuickCheck models using the Specification Converter. This process involved parsing the Given-When-Then scenarios and mapping them to formal properties that QuickCheck could utilize to generate and execute test cases.

Example Conversion:

Gherkin Scenario:

gherkin
Copy code
Feature: Appointment Scheduling

Scenario: Schedule a new appointment
  Given I am logged into the health portal
  When I navigate to the appointment scheduling page
  And I enter valid appointment details
  And I submit the appointment request
  Then I should see a confirmation message
  And the appointment should appear in my schedule
QuickCheck Model:

haskell
Copy code
-- QuickCheck property for scheduling a new appointment
prop_scheduleAppointment :: State -> Property
prop_scheduleAppointment state =
  isLoggedIn state == True ==> 
    navigateTo "appointment scheduling page" == AppointmentSchedulingPage
    .&&. enterDetails validDetails == ValidDetailsEntered
    .&&. submitRequest == ConfirmationMessage
    .&&. appointmentExistsInSchedule
Telemetry Integration
Telemetry agents were deployed to monitor key metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and response times. These metrics were continuously collected and analyzed by the Telemetry and Monitor Agents to detect anomalies and trigger necessary adaptations.

Example Telemetry Data:

json
Copy code
{
  "timestamp": "2024-04-25T14:23:05Z",
  "agent_name": "ServiceAgent",
  "state": "OPERATING",
  "cpu_usage": 75.5,
  "memory_usage": 1500.0,
  "response_time": 350.0
}
Adaptation Triggers
During testing, the Monitor Agent detected a spike in response times exceeding the 500 ms threshold during peak usage hours. It triggered an adaptation request to the Service Agents to optimize resource allocation, resulting in reduced response times and improved system performance.

Results
Increased Test Coverage: Automated generation of inter-scenario test cases uncovered previously undetected issues related to sequential operations.
Improved System Reliability: Real-time telemetry monitoring enabled proactive detection and resolution of performance bottlenecks.
Enhanced Adaptability: The system adapted to high-load conditions dynamically, maintaining optimal performance without manual intervention.

"""The BaseInhabitant Module for Reactive Domain-Driven Design (RDDDY) Framework
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This module implements the core Inhabitant abstraction within the RDDDY framework, providing a robust foundation for building reactive, domain-driven systems that are scalable, maintainable, and capable of handling complex, concurrent interactions. The Inhabitant model encapsulates both state and behavior, allowing for asynchronous message passing as the primary means of communication between inhabitants, thus fostering loose coupling and enhanced system resilience.

### Overview

Inhabitants are the fundamental units of computation in the RDDDY framework. Each inhabitant possesses a unique identity, a mailbox for message queuing, and a set of behaviors to handle incoming messages. The Inhabitant module facilitates the creation, supervision, and coordination of inhabitants within an ServiceColony, ensuring that messages are delivered and processed in a manner consistent with the system's domain-driven design principles.

### Multiline Calculus for Inhabitant Behavior Specification

The operational semantics of inhabitants within the RDDDY framework are formalized through a rigorous multiline calculus, which outlines the preconditions, postconditions, and invariants that govern inhabitant behavior and interaction. This calculus serves as a contract, ensuring that inhabitants behave correctly and predictably within their designated domain contexts.

#### Inhabitant State Transition

Given an inhabitant \(A\) with state \(s\) and a message \(m\), the state transition is defined as:

Precondition ( Pre Pre): 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 s∈S and 𝑚 ∈ 𝑀 m∈M
Transition: 𝑇 ( 𝑠 , 𝑚 ) → 𝑠 ′ T(s,m)→s ′
Postcondition ( Post Post): 𝑠 ′ ∈ 𝑆 ′ s ′ ∈S ′

#### Message Handling

For a message \(m\) handled by the inhabitant, leading to a state modification:

Precondition ( Pre Pre): 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 s∈S and 𝑚 ∈ 𝑀 m∈M
Handling: 𝐻 ( 𝑚 , 𝑠 ) → 𝑠 ′ ′ H(m,s)→s ′′
Postcondition ( Post Post): 𝑠 ′ ′ ∈ 𝑆 ′ ′ s ′′ ∈S ′′

#### Invariant Maintenance

Ensuring system invariants \(I\) across transitions:

Invariant: 𝐼 ( 𝑆 ) ∧ 𝑇 ( 𝑠 , 𝑚 ) → 𝑠 ′ ⇒ 𝐼 ( 𝑆 ′ ) I(S)∧T(s,m)→s ′ ⇒I(S ′ )

#### Domain-Specific Assertions

Linking inhabitant state transitions to domain logic:

Precondition ( Pre Pre): Δ ( 𝑠 ) Δ(s) and 𝛿 ( 𝑚 ) δ(m)
Domain Logic: 𝐷 ( 𝑠 , 𝑚 ) → Δ ( 𝑠 ′ ) D(s,m)→Δ(s ′ )
Postcondition ( Post Post): Δ ′ ( 𝑠 ′ ) Δ ′ (s ′ )

### Purpose

This calculus not only specifies the expected behavior of inhabitants in response to messages but also integrates domain-specific knowledge, ensuring that inhabitants operate in alignment with the broader domain-driven objectives of the system. By adhering to these specifications, the Inhabitant module provides a reliable and expressive framework for developing systems that are both technically sound and closely aligned with domain requirements.

### Usage

Developers should implement inhabitant behaviors in accordance with the outlined calculus, ensuring that each inhabitant's implementation respects the preconditions, postconditions, and domain-specific assertions relevant to their system's domain logic. This approach facilitates the development of systems that are not only functionally correct but also domain-compliant, thereby enhancing the value and applicability of the RDDDY framework in real-world scenarios.

# Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into enterprise systems has become a cornerstone of modern technological advancements. However, developing scalable, maintainable, and reliable AI solutions poses significant challenges, including managing complex workflows, ensuring code quality, aligning technical specifications with business requirements, and facilitating seamless deployment and testing. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an integrated framework combining **DSPyGen**, **Sungen**, and **PLAN Pro**, all orchestrated through the **Typer CLI** framework.

**DSPyGen** and **Sungen** provide a modular and command-line driven approach to AI development, inspired by the efficiency and modularity of frameworks like Ruby on Rails. **DSPyGen** simplifies the creation, development, and deployment of language model (LM) pipelines, while **Sungen** extends these capabilities by offering comprehensive workflow automation, code generation, project management, and integrated development support. 

On the other hand, **PLAN Pro** bridges the gap between **Agile Protocol Specifications (APS)** and **Model-Based Testing (MBT)** within service colony architectures, facilitating automated, model-based testing that enhances system reliability and adaptability. By converting Gherkin-based specifications into machine-readable models compatible with tools like QuickCheck, **PLAN Pro** enables comprehensive inter-scenario testing and seamless integration of telemetry for real-time monitoring.

This integrated approach not only streamlines AI development workflows but also ensures that testing processes are robust, automated, and aligned with both technical and business-level requirements. We demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of this integrated framework through a case study on Malta’s national health portal, highlighting significant improvements in test coverage, system reliability, and adaptability.

# Related Work

The development and integration of AI systems within enterprises have been extensively studied, focusing on various aspects such as workflow automation, model-based testing, and scalable architecture design.

## Model-Based Testing (MBT)

MBT has been recognized for its potential to enhance the verification and validation of software systems by leveraging formal models to generate test cases [1]. Tools like QuickCheck have popularized property-based testing, enabling developers to specify properties that their code should satisfy, with the tool generating corresponding test cases [2]. However, the adoption of MBT in industry remains limited due to challenges in aligning technical specifications with business-level requirements and managing dynamic system specifications.

## Agile Protocol Specification (APS)

Agile methodologies, particularly Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) [3], emphasize close collaboration between developers and non-technical stakeholders. BDD employs natural language specifications, often written in Gherkin [8], to define system behaviors in terms of Given-When-Then scenarios. While BDD enhances communication and ensures alignment with business requirements, integrating these specifications with MBT tools that require formal models presents significant challenges.

## Workflow Automation and Modular Design

Frameworks like Ruby on Rails have demonstrated the benefits of a modular and convention-over-configuration approach to software development, enhancing productivity and maintainability. **DSPyGen** and **Sungen** draw inspiration from such frameworks, providing a command-line driven, modular approach to AI development that simplifies workflow automation, code generation, and project management.

## Service Colony Architectures

Service colony architectures structure systems as collections of interacting agents, offering scalability and resilience [5]. Integrating MBT within such architectures necessitates efficient communication protocols and robust monitoring mechanisms to handle dynamic interactions between agents. **PLAN Pro** addresses these requirements by integrating APS with MBT, facilitating automated testing and real-time system monitoring within service colony frameworks.

# System Architecture

The integrated framework combines **DSPyGen**, **Sungen**, and **PLAN Pro** to provide a comprehensive environment for enterprise AI development, deployment, and testing. The architecture leverages the **Typer CLI** framework to facilitate user interactions through command-line commands, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow.

PLAN Pro Framework
PLAN Pro is an architectural framework designed to integrate Agile Protocol Specifications (APS) with model-based testing (MBT) within service colony architectures. It automates the conversion of Gherkin-based specifications into machine-readable models compatible with MBT tools like QuickCheck, facilitating comprehensive inter-scenario testing and leveraging telemetry for real-time system monitoring and adaptation.

Specification Converter
The Specification Converter automates the transformation of Gherkin-based specifications into QuickCheck-compatible models. It parses Gherkin scenarios, extracts relevant information, and generates formal properties that QuickCheck can utilize to generate and execute test cases.

Example Conversion
Gherkin Scenario:

gherkin
Copy code
Feature: Appointment Scheduling

Scenario: Schedule a new appointment
  Given I am logged into the health portal
  When I navigate to the appointment scheduling page
  And I enter valid appointment details
  And I submit the appointment request
  Then I should see a confirmation message
  And the appointment should appear in my schedule
Converted QuickCheck Model:

haskell
Copy code
-- QuickCheck property for scheduling a new appointment
prop_scheduleAppointment :: State -> Property
prop_scheduleAppointment state =
  isLoggedIn state == True ==> 
    navigateTo "appointment scheduling page" == AppointmentSchedulingPage
    .&&. enterDetails validDetails == ValidDetailsEntered
    .&&. submitRequest == ConfirmationMessage
    .&&. appointmentExistsInSchedule
Telemetry Integration Module
The Telemetry Integration Module collects, processes, and utilizes telemetry data to monitor system performance and trigger adaptive responses. By integrating telemetry, the system can monitor performance in real-time, identify anomalies, and adapt testing strategies dynamically.

Example Telemetry Data
json
Copy code
{
  "timestamp": "2024-04-25T14:23:05Z",
  "agent_name": "ServiceAgent",
  "state": "OPERATING",
  "cpu_usage": 75.5,
  "memory_usage": 1500.0,
  "response_time": 350.0
}
Service Colony Agents
Service Colony consists of various agents, each with defined roles and responsibilities as specified by APS. Key agents include:

Service Agents: Perform dedicated functionalities and interact with other agents.
Telemetry Agents: Collect and process telemetry data from Service Agents.
Monitor Agents: Analyze telemetry data, detect anomalies, and trigger system adaptations.
Model-Based Testing Engine
Utilizing QuickCheck, the MBT Engine generates test cases based on the formal models produced by the Specification Converter. These test cases are designed to explore different scenarios, including inter-scenario interactions, ensuring thorough validation of the system against its specifications.

Case Studies
Malta’s National Health Portal
To validate the effectiveness of the integrated framework, we applied DSPyGen, Sungen, and PLAN Pro to Malta’s national health portal—a critical web application managing sensitive health data, scheduling appointments, and providing access to medical records. Ensuring the portal's reliability and performance is paramount for serving Maltese residents.

Objectives
Automate Test Case Generation: Convert existing Gherkin-based specifications into QuickCheck models for automated MBT.
Enhance Test Coverage: Include inter-scenario interactions to identify potential issues arising from sequential operations.
Integrate Telemetry: Monitor system performance in real-time and adapt testing strategies based on telemetry insights.
Implementation
Specification Conversion
Using PLAN Pro, we converted the portal’s Gherkin specifications into QuickCheck models via the Specification Converter.

Gherkin Scenario:

Scenario: Schedule a new appointment
  Given I am logged into the health portal
  When I navigate to the appointment scheduling page
  And I enter valid appointment details

prop_scheduleAppointment state =
  isLoggedIn state == True ==> 
    navigateTo "appointment scheduling page" == AppointmentSchedulingPage
    .&&. enterDetails validDetails == ValidDetailsEntered
    .&&. submitRequest == ConfirmationMessage
    .&&. appointmentExistsInSchedule
Telemetry Integration
Telemetry agents were deployed to monitor key metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and response times. These metrics were continuously collected and analyzed by the Telemetry and Monitor Agents to detect anomalies and trigger necessary adaptations.

Telemetry Data Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "timestamp": "2024-04-25T14:23:05Z",
  "agent_name": "ServiceAgent",
  "state": "OPERATING",
  "cpu_usage": 75.5,
  "memory_usage": 1500.0,
  "response_time": 350.0
}
AI Module and Agent Integration
Using DSPyGen and Sungen, we created AI modules for automated code generation and testing. Agents like CoderAgent and ChallengerSalesAgent were implemented to manage coding tasks and sales processes within the service colony architecture.
